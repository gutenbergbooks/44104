<p class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT.</p>

<p>The present volume of the <span class="smcap">Native Races of the
Pacific States</span> treats of monumental archæology, and
is intended to present a detailed description of all material
relics of the past discovered within the territory
under consideration. Two chapters, however, are devoted
to a more general view of remains outside the
limits of this territory&mdash;those of South America and
of the eastern United States&mdash;as being illustrative of,
and of inseparable interest in connection with, my subject
proper. Since monumental remains in the western
continent without the broad limits thus included are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
comparatively few and unimportant, I may without
exaggeration, if the execution of the work be in any
degree commensurate with its aim, claim for this
treatise a place among the most complete ever published
on American antiquities as a whole. Indeed,
Mr Baldwin's most excellent little book on
Ancient America is the only comprehensive work treating
of this subject now before the public. As a popular
treatise, compressing within a small duodecimo
volume the whole subject of archæology, including, besides
material relics, tradition, and speculation concerning
origin and history as well, this book cannot be too
highly praised; I propose, however, by devoting a
large octavo volume to one half or less of Mr Baldwin's
subject-matter, to add at least encyclopedic value
to this division of my work.</p>

<p>There are some departments of the present subject
in which I can hardly hope to improve upon or even
to equal descriptions already extant. Such are the
ruins of Yucatan, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, so ably
treated by Messrs Stephens, Catherwood, and Squier.
Indeed, not a few relics of great importance are known
to the world only through the pen or pencil of one
or another of these gentlemen, in which cases I am
forced to draw somewhat largely upon the result of
their investigations. Yet even within the territory
mentioned, concerning Uxmal and Chichen Itza we
have most valuable details in the works of M. M. Waldeck
and Charnay; at Quirigua, Dr Scherzer's labors
are no less satisfactory than those of Mr Catherwood;
and Mr Squier's careful observations in Nicaragua are
supplemented, to the advantage of the antiquarian
public, by the scarcely less extensive investigations of
Mr Boyle. In the case of Palenque, in some respects
the most remarkable American ruin, we have, besides
the exhaustive delineations of Waldeck and Stephens,
several others scarcely less satisfactory or interesting
from the pens of competent observers; and in a large
majority of instances each locality, if not each separate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
relic, has been described from personal examination by
several parties, each noting some particulars by the
others neglected. By a careful study and comparison
of information drawn from all available sources respecting
the several points, the witnesses mutually corroborating
or correcting one another's statements, I
expect to arrive in each case practically at the truth,
and thus to compensate in a measure for that loss of
interest inevitably incurred by the necessary omission
of that personal experience and adventure by which
antiquarian travelers are wont to impart a charm to
their otherwise dry details.</p>

<p>Although necessarily to a great extent a compilation,
this volume is none the less the result of hard
and long-continued study. It embodies the researches
of some five hundred travelers, stated not merely en
résumé, but reproduced, so far as facts and results are
concerned, in full. Very few of the many works studied
are devoted exclusively or even chiefly to my subject;
indeed most of them have but an occasional reference
to antiquarian relics, which are described more or
less fully among other objects of interest that come under
the traveler's eye; hence the possibility of condensing
satisfactorily the contents of so many volumes in one, and
of making this one fill on the shelves of the antiquary's
library the place of all, excepting, of course, the large
plates of the folio works. Full references to, and quotations
from, the authorities consulted are given in the
notes, which thus become a complete index to all that has
been written on the subject. These notes contain also
bibliographical notices and historical details of the discovery
and successive explorations of each ruin, and
other information not without interest and value. That
some few books containing archæological information
may have escaped my notice, is quite possible, but
none I believe of sufficient importance to seriously impair
the value of the material here presented. In
order to give a clear idea of the great variety of articles
preserved from the past for our examination, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
use of numerous illustrations becomes absolutely essential.
Of the cuts employed many are the originals
taken from the published works of explorers, particularly
of Messrs Stephens and Squier, with their permission.
As I make no claim to personal archæological
research, save among the tomes on the shelves of my
library, and as the imparting of accurate information
is my only aim, the advantage of the original cuts
over any copies that could be made, will be manifest
to the reader. Where such originals could not be obtained
I have made accurate copies of drawings carefully
selected from what I have deemed the best
authorities, always with a view to give the clearest
possible idea of the objects described, and with no attempt
at mere pictorial embellishment.</p>

<p>Confining myself strictly to the description of material
remains, I have omitted, or reserved for another
volume, all traditions and speculations of a general
nature respecting their origin and the people whose
handiwork they are, giving, however, in some instances,
such definite traditions as seem unlikely to come up in
connection with ancient history. This is in accordance
with the general plan which I adopt in treating of the
Native Races of this western half of North America,
proceeding from the known to the unknown, from the
near to the remote; dealing first with the observed
phenomena of aboriginal savagism and civilization
when first brought within the knowledge of Europeans,
as I have done in the three volumes already before
the public; then entering the labyrinthine field of antiquity
from its least obstructed side, I devote this
volume to material relics exclusively, thus preparing
the way for a final volume on traditional and written
archæology, to terminate with what most authors have
given at the start,&mdash;the vaguest and most hopelessly
complicated department of the whole subject,&mdash;speculations
respecting the origin of the American people and
of the western civilization.</p>

<p>In the descriptions which follow I proceed geographically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
from south to north for no reason more cogent
than that of convenience. From the same motive,
much more weighty however in this case, I follow the
same order in my comparisons between remains in different
parts of the continent, comparing invariably each
ruin with others farther south and consequently familiar
to the reader, rather than with more northern structures
to be described later. It is claimed by some
writers that the term antiquities is properly used only
to designate the works of a people extinct or only traditionally
known. This restriction of the term would
exclude most of the monumental remains of the Pacific
States, since a large majority of the objects described
in the following pages are known to have been the
work of the peoples found by Europeans in possession
of the country, or of their immediate ancestors. I
employ the term, however, in its more common application,
including in it all the works of aboriginal hands
presumably executed before native intercourse with
Europeans, at dates varying consequently with that of
the discovery of different localities.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REALITY OF MATERIAL RELICS.</p>

<p class="p2">Monumental archæology, as distinguished from written
and traditional archæology, owes its interest largely
to its reality and tangibility. The teachings of material
relics, so far as they go, are irrefutable. Real in themselves
they impart an air of reality to the study of the
past. They stand before us as the actual work of human
hands, affording no foothold for scepticism; they
are the balance-wheels of tradition, resting-places for
the mind wearied with the study of aboriginal fable,
stepping-stones on which to cross the miry sloughs
of mythic history. The ruins of a great city represent
and recall vividly its original state and the populace
that once thronged its streets; the towering mound or
pyramid brings before the observer's mind toiling bands
of slaves driven to their unwelcome task by strong
progressive masters; temples and idols are but remnants
of religious systems, native fear, superstition,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and faith; altars imply victims and sacrificial ceremonies;
sculpture, the existence of art; kingly palaces
are the result of a strong government, wars, and conquest;
sepulchral deposits reveal thoughts of another
life; and hieroglyphic inscriptions, even if their key
be lost, imply events deemed worthy of record, and a
degree of progress toward letters.</p>

<p>What the personal souvenir is to the memory of
dead friends, what the ancestral mansion with its portraits
and other relics is to family memories and pride of
descent, what the ancient battle-ground with the monument
commemorating early struggles for liberty is to national
patriotism, what the familiar hill, valley, stream,
and tree to recollection and love of home,&mdash;all this and
more are material relics to the study of ages gone by.
Destroy such relics in the case of the individual, the
family, and the nation, and imagine the effect on our
interest in a past, which is, however, in nearly every
instance clearly recorded. What would be the consequence
of blotting from existence the ruins that stand
as monuments of a past but vaguely known even in the
most favorable circumstances through the medium of
traditionary and written annals? Traditional archæology,
fascinating as its study is and important in its
results, leaves always in the mind a feeling of uncertainty,
a fear that any particular tradition may be in
its present form, modified willfully or involuntarily in
passing through many hands, a distortion of the original,
or perhaps a pure invention; or if intact in form
its primary signification may be altogether misunderstood.
And even in the case of written annals, more
definite and reliable of course than oral traditions, we
cannot forget that back beyond a certain time impossible
to locate in the distant past, history founds its
statements of events on no more substantial basis
than popular fable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COUNTERFEIT ANTIQUITIES.</p>

<p>It is true that false reports may be made respecting
the discovery or nature of ruined cities and other
monuments; and relics may be collected and exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
which have no claim whatever to antiquity. Indeed
it is said that in some parts of Spanish America, Aztec,
Chichimec, or Toltec relics, of any desired era since
the creation, are manufactured to order by the ingenious
natives and sold to the enthusiastic but unwary antiquarian.
To similar imposition and like enthusiasm
may be referred the long list of Roman, Greek, Scandinavian,
Tyrian, and other old-world coins, medals, and
inscriptions, whose discovery in the New World from
time to time has been reported, and used in support of
some pet origin-theory. Yet practically these counterfeit
or fabulous antiquities do little harm; their
falsity may in most cases be without difficulty detected,
as will be apparent from several instances of the kind
noted in the following pages. There are, as I have
said, few ruins of any importance that have not been
described by more than one competent and reliable explorer.
The discovery of wonderful cities and palaces,
or of movable relics which differ essentially from the
well-authenticated antiquities of the same region, is
not accepted by archæologists, or by the public generally,
without more positive proof of genuineness than
the representations of a single traveler whose reliability
has not been fully proved.</p>

<p class="p2">The study of ancient monuments, in addition to its
high degree of interest, is moreover of great practical
value in the development of historical science, as a
source of positive information, as a corroboration of annals
otherwise recorded, and as an incentive to continued
research. It contributes to actual knowledge
by indicating the various arts that flourished among the
peoples of antiquity, the germs of the corresponding
arts of modern times. The monuments show not alone
the precise degree of excellence in architecture and
sculpture attained by the particular people whose work
they are, but by an examination of their differences
they throw much light on the origin and growth of
these and other arts, while by comparison with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
works of other peoples better known they serve to establish
more or less clearly national affinities. And
not only do they illustrate the state of the fine and
useful arts, but also to a great extent public institutions
and private customs. Temples, idols, and altars
reveal much of religious rites and priestly power;
weapons, of warfare; implements, of household habits;
ornaments, of dress; tombs and sepulchral relics, of burial
ceremonies, regard for the dead, and ideas respecting
another life. When, in addition to their indirect teachings
respecting the arts and institutions of their builders,
antique monuments bear also inscriptions in written
or legible hieroglyphic characters, their value is of
course greatly increased; indeed under such circumstances
they become the very highest historic authority.</p>

<p>It is, however, in connection with the other branches
of the science, written and traditional, that material
relics accomplish their most satisfactory results, their
corroborative evidence being even more valuable than
the positive information they convey. For instance,
tradition relates wondrous tales of the wealth, power,
and mighty deeds of a people that long ago occupied
what is now a barren desert or a dense forest. These
tales are classed with other aboriginal fables, interesting
but comparatively valueless; but some wandering explorer,
by chance or as the result of an apparently absurd
and profitless research, discovers in the shade of the
tangled thicket, or lays bare under the drifting desert-sands,
the ruins of a great city with magnificent palace
and temple; at once the mythic fable is transformed
into authentic history, especially if the traditional
statements of that people's arts and institutions are
confirmed by their relics.</p>

<p>Again, the written record of biblical tradition, unsatisfactory
to some, when not supported by corroborative
evidence, narrates with minute detail the history of
an ancient city, including its conquest at a given date by
a foreign king. The discovery in another land of that
monarch's statue or triumphal arch, inscribed with his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
name, title, and a list of his deeds, confirms or invalidates
the scriptural account not only of that particular event
but indirectly of other details of the city's annals not
recorded in stone. In America material relics acquire
increased importance as corroborative and corrective
witnesses, in comparison with those of the old world,
from the absence of contemporary written annals. Beside
constituting the only tangible supports of the more
ancient triumphs of American civilization, they are
the best illustrations of comparatively modern stages
of art whose products have disappeared, and by no
means superfluous in support of Spanish chroniclers in
later times, "very many, or perhaps most of whose
statements respecting the wonderful phenomena of the
New World culture," as I have remarked in a preceding
volume, "without this incontrovertible material
proof would find few believers among the sceptical students
of the present day."</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">IMPORTANCE OF MATERIAL RELICS.</p>

<p class="p2">The importance of monumental remains as incentives
to historical study and research results directly from
the interest and curiosity which their examination invariably
excites. Gibbon relates that he was first
prompted to write the annals of Rome's decline and
fall by the contemplation of her ruined structures. Few
even of the most prosaic and matter-of-fact travelers
can resist the impulse to reason and speculate on the
origin of ruins that come under their notice, and the
civilization to which they owe their existence; and
there are probably few eminent archæologists but may
trace the first development of a taste for antiquarian
pursuits to the curiosity excited at the sight of some
mysterious relic.</p>

<p>This irresistible desire to follow back remains of art
to the artist's hand and genius, prompted the oft-repeated
and so long fruitless attempts to decipher the
Egyptian hieroglyphics and the cuneiform inscriptions
of Persia and Assyria. These efforts were at last
crowned with success; the key to the mysterious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
wedges, and the Rosetta-stone were found, by which
the tablets of Babylon, Ninevah, and the pyramids&mdash;the
Palenque, Copan, and Teotihuacan of the old
world&mdash;may be read. The palaces, monuments, and
statues of ancient kings bear legible records of their
lives, dominions, and succession. By the aid of these
records definite dates are established for events in the
history of these countries as early as two thousand
years before the Christian era, and thus corroborations
and checks are placed on the statements of biblical
and profane history. But the art of interpreting these
hieroglyphics is yet in its infancy, and the results thus
far accomplished are infinitesimal in comparison with
what may be reasonably anticipated in the future.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HUMAN RACE.</p>

<p class="p2">So much for antique monuments and their teachings&mdash;alone
and in connection with history and tradition&mdash;respecting
the peoples to whom they owe their
existence. Another and not less important value they
have, in connection with geology and paleontology, in
what they tell us about the age of the human race on
the earth. Biblical tradition, as interpreted in former
times, asserts the earth and its inhabitants to be about
six thousand years old. Geology has enforced a new
interpretation, which, so far as the age of the earth is
concerned, is accepted by all latter-day scholars; and
geology now lends a helping hand to her sister sciences
in their effort to prove, what is not yet universally accepted
as truth, that man's antiquity far exceeds the
limit which scripture is thought to establish.</p>

<p>Throughout the successive geologic strata of earthy
matter that overlie the solid rocky foundations below,
traces of man's presence are found. It is in deposits
of peat and alluvium that these traces are most clearly
defined and with greatest facility studied. The extremely
slow accumulation of these deposits and the
great depth at which human remains appear, impress
the mind of the observer with a vivid idea of their
antiquity. Calculations based on the known rate of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
increase for a definite period fix the age of the lowest
relics at from six thousand to one hundred thousand
years according to the locality. But geology tells
yet no definite tale in years, her chronology being
on a grander scale, and these calculations are to
scientific men the weakest proofs of man's antiquity.
As we penetrate, however, this superficial
geologic formation, we find in the upper layers weapons
and implements of iron; then, at a greater depth, of
bronze; and lowest of all stone is the only durable
material employed. In all parts of the world, so far
as explorations have been made, this order of the ages,
stone, bronze, iron, is observed; although they were
certainly not contemporaneous in all regions. With
the products of human skill, in its varying stages of
development, are mingled the fossil trees and plants of
different species which flourished and became locally
extinct as the centuries passed away. So animal remains,
no less abundant than the others, indicate successive
changes in the fauna and its relations to human
life, the animals pursued at different epochs for food,
the introduction of domestic animals, and the transition
from the chase to agriculture as a means of subsistence.</p>

<p>From a study of all these various relics of the
past&mdash;human, animal, and vegetable&mdash;in connection
with geologic changes, the student seeks to estimate approximately
the date at which man first appeared upon
the earth. He observes the slow accumulation of surface
deposits and speculates on the time requisite to
bury the works of man hundreds of feet deep in dilluvium.
He studies savagism in its different phases as
portrayed in a previous volume; notes how tenaciously
the primitive man clings to old customs, how averse he
is to change and improvement; and then reflects upon
the centuries that would probably suffice for beings only
a little above the beast to pass successively from the use
of the shapeless stone and club to the polished stone
spear and arrow and knife, to the partial displacement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
of stone by the fragment of crude metal, to the smelting
of the less refractory ores and the mixture of metals
to form bronze, and to a final triumph in the use of
iron. He reflects farther that all this slow process of
development precedes in nearly every part of the world
the historic period; that its relics are found in the alluvial
plains of the Nile, buried far below the monuments
of Egyptian civilization, a civilization, moreover, which
dates back at least two thousand years before Christ.
Searching the peat-beds of Denmark, he brings to light
fossil Scotch firs in the lower strata mingled with relics
of the stone age; oak-trees above with implements of
bronze; and beech-trunks in the upper deposits, corresponding
with the iron age and also with the present
forest-growth of the country. He tries to fix upon a
period of years adequate to effect two complete changes
in Danish forest-trees, bringing to his aid the fact that
about the Christian era the Romans found that country
covered as now with a luxurious growth of beech, and
that consequently eighteen hundred years have wrought
no change. Having thus established in his mind the
epoch to which he must be carried by the relics of the
alluvial deposits, he remarks that during all this period
climate has not essentially changed, for the animal remains
thus far discovered are all of species still existing
in the same climatic zone.</p>

<p>But at the same time he finds in southern Europe
abundant remains of polar animals which could only
have lived when the everlasting snow and ice of a
frigid clime covered the surface of those now sunny
lands. Still finding rude stone implements, the work
of human hands, mingled with these polar skeletons,
he adds to the result of previous computations the
time deemed necessary for so essential a climatic transformation,
and, finally, he is driven to make still another
addition, when he learns that in geologic strata
much older than any yet considered, the bones and
works of man have been discovered in several apparently
well-authenticated instances lying side by side
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
with the bones of mastodons and other ancient species
which have long since disappeared from the face of the
earth. With the innumerable data of which the foregoing
is only an outline before him, the student of man's
antiquity is left to decide for himself whether or not he
can satisfactorily compress within the term of sixty
centuries all the successive periods of man's development.</p>

<p>In our examination of relics in the thinly peopled
Pacific States we shall find comparatively few works
of human hands bearing directly on this branch of
archæology; yet in the north-west regions, newest to
modern civilization, the Californian miner's deep-sunk
shafts have brought to light implements and fossils of
great antiquity and interest to the scientific world.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">AMERICAN RELICS AND HIEROGLYPHICS.</p>

<p class="p2">In America many years must elapse before explorations
equaling in extent and thoroughness those already
made in the old world can be hoped for. The ruins
from whose examination the grandest results are to be
anticipated lie in a hot malarious climate within the
tropics, enveloped in a dense thicket of exuberant vegetation,
presenting an almost impenetrable barrier to an
exploration by foreigners of monuments in which the
natives as a rule take no interest. It must be admitted,
however, that even the most exhaustive examination
of our relics cannot be expected to yield results
as definite and satisfactory as those reached in the eastern
continent. We have practically no written record,
and our monuments must tell the tale of the distant
past unaided.</p>

<p>Our hieroglyphic inscriptions are comparatively few
and brief, and those found on the stones of the more
ancient class of ruins as yet convey no meaning. By
reason of the absence of a contemporary written language,
the difficulties in the way of their interpretation
are clearly much greater than those so brilliantly
overcome in Assyria and Egypt. Only one systematic
attempt has yet been made to decipher their signification,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and that has thus far proved a signal failure; it
is believed almost universally that future efforts will
be equally unsuccessful, and that our annals as written
in stone will forever remain wrapped in darkness. Yet
not only was the interpretation of the cuneiform inscriptions
long deemed an impossibility, but the very theory
that any meaning was hidden in that complicated arrangement
of wedges was pronounced absurd by many
wise antiquaries. Let not therefore our New World
task be abandoned in despair till the list of failures
shall be swollen from one to seventy times seven.</p>

<p>It is believed that the antiquary's zeal for all coming
time will be brought to bear on no other objects than
those which now claim our attention and search; that is,
although new monuments will be brought to light from
their present hiding-places, no additions will be made
to their actual number. With the invention of printing
and the consequent wide diffusion of national annals,
the era of unwritten history ceased, and with it all
future necessity of searching tangled forest and desert
plain for monumental records of the present civilization.
That the key of our written history can ever
be lost, our civilization blotted out, ruined structures
and vague traditions called anew into requisition for
historic use, we believe impossible. Yet who can tell;
for so doubtless thought the learned men and high-priests
of Palenque, when with imposing pageant and
sacrificial invocation to the gods in the presence of the
assembled populace, the inscribed tablets had been set
up in the niches of the temple; and proudly exclaimed
the orator of the day, as the last tablet settled into
its place, "Great are our gods, and goodly the inheritance
they have bequeathed to their chosen people.
Mighty is Votan, world-wide the fame of his empire,
the great Xibalba; and the annals and the glory thereof
shall endure through all the coming ages; for are they
not here imperishably inscribed in characters of everlasting
stone that all may read and wonder?"

have left interesting relics of their antiquity, which, with
some points of resemblance, present marked contrasts

extending from the gulf of Darien westward to Costa
Rica, no such relics have yet come to light, except in
the western provinces of Chiriquí and Veragua, notwithstanding
the extensive explorations that have been
made in various parts of the Isthmus in the interests
of interoceanic communication.<a id="FNanchor_II-2" href="#Footnote_II-2" class="fnanchor">[II-2]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHIRIQUÍ ROCK-SCULPTURES.</p>

<p>The province of Chiriquí lies on the Pacific side of the
Isthmus, and it is in its central region about the town of
David, that monuments of a past age have been unearthed.<a id="FNanchor_II-3" href="#Footnote_II-3" class="fnanchor">[II-3]</a>
These monuments are of three classes; the
first consisting of rude figures cut on the surface of
large boulders. The best known of this class, and in fact
the only one definitely described, is the Piedra Pintal at
Caldera, a few leagues from David, which is fifteen feet
high, about sixteen in diameter, and somewhat flattened
at the top. Top and sides are covered with curves,
ovals, and concentric rings; while on the eastern side
there are also fantastic figures, with others supposed to
represent the sun, a series of varying heads, and scorpions.
The figures are cut to a depth of about one inch, but on
the parts most exposed to the weather are nearly effaced.</p>

<p class="caption">Incised Figures on the Rocks of Chiriquí.</p>
</div>

<p>Another lava boulder similarly incised found in the
parish of San Miguel is pronounced by Mr Squier,
from the examination of a drawing, to resemble stones
seen by him in other parts of Central America. I copy
Seemann's cuts of several of the characters.<a id="FNanchor_II-4" href="#Footnote_II-4" class="fnanchor">[II-4]</a> The second
class includes a few stone columns, some of them ten or
twelve feet high, found at David and in Veragua as well.
These seem never to have been seen in situ, but scattered
and sometimes used for building purposes by the
present inhabitants. Their peculiarity is that the characters
engraved on their surface are entirely different
from those of the Piedra Pintal, being smaller and cut
in low relief. Drawings of these possibly hieroglyphic
signs, by which to compare them with those of Copan,
Palenque, and Yucatan, are not extant. The third
class comprises the <i>huacas</i>, or tombs, a large number of
which have been opened, and a variety of deposited
articles brought to light. The tombs themselves are
of two kinds. Those of the first kind are mere pebble-heaps,
or mounds, three or four feet high, and the only
articles taken from them are three-legged stones for
grinding corn, known in all Spanish America as <i>metates</i>.
The other graves have rude boxes or coffins of flat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
stones, with, in a few instances, rude stone posts several
feet in height. Graves of this class are found to contain
golden ornaments, with trinkets and implements of
stone and burned clay. In most of them no traces of
human remains are met; and when human bones do
occur, they usually crumble to dust on exposure to
the air, one skull, however, described as broad in the
middle and flat behind, having been secured, and a
plaster cast exhibited to the American Ethnological
Society.<a id="FNanchor_II-5" href="#Footnote_II-5" class="fnanchor">[II-5]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">POTTERY OF CHIRIQUÍ.</p>

<p>The golden ornaments taken from the huacas of
Chiriquí amount to many thousands of dollars in value.
They are of small size, never exceeding a few inches
in either dimension, are all cast and never soldered,
and take the shape of men, animals, or birds. One
represents a man holding a bird in each hand, with
another on his forehead. The gold is described by Dr
Davis as being from ten to twenty carats fine, with
some copper alloy; but by another party the alloy is
pronounced silver.<a id="FNanchor_II-6" href="#Footnote_II-6" class="fnanchor">[II-6]</a> Of stone are found ornaments, such
as round agates pierced in the middle; weapons, including
axes, chisel-heads, and arrow-heads, the latter of
peculiar make, being pyramidal in form, with four cutting
edges converging to a point, and in some instances
apparently intended to fit loosely into a socket on the
shaft; images, perhaps idols, in the shape of animals
or men, but these are of comparatively rare occurrence;<a id="FNanchor_II-7" href="#Footnote_II-7" class="fnanchor">[II-7]</a>
and various articles of unknown use. One of the latter
dug up at Bugabita is described as a "horizontal
tablet, supported on ornamented legs, and terminating
in the head of a monster&mdash;all neatly carved from a single
stone," being twenty inches long, eight inches high,
and weighing twenty-five pounds. Another was conjectured
to have served for grinding paints.<a id="FNanchor_II-8" href="#Footnote_II-8" class="fnanchor">[II-8]</a> Articles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of burned clay are more numerous in the huacas than
those of other material. Small vases, jars, and tripods,
some of the latter having their three legs hollow and
containing small earthen balls which rattle when the
vessels are moved, with musical instruments, compose
this class of relics. The earthen ware has no indication
of the use of the potter's wheel; is found both
glazed and unglazed; is painted in various colors,
which, however, are not burned in, but are easily
rubbed off when moist; and many of the articles are
wholly uninjured by time. The specimens, or some
part of each, are almost invariably molded to imitate
some natural object, and the fashioning is often graceful
and true to nature. Perhaps the most remarkable
of these earthen specimens, and indeed of all the
Chiriquí antiquities, are the musical wind-instruments,
or whistles. These are of small dimensions, rarely exceeding
four inches in length or diameter, with generally
two but sometimes three or four finger-holes,
producing from two to six notes of the octave. No
two are exactly alike in form, but most take the shape
of an animal or man, the mouth-hole being in the tail
of the tiger and bird, in the foot of the peccary, in the
elbow of the human figure. Some have several air-cavities
with corresponding holes to produce the different
notes, but in most, the holes lead to one cavity.
One had a loose ball in its interior, whose motion varied
the sounds. Several are blown like fifes, and nearly all
have a hole apparently intended for suspending the instrument
by a string.<a id="FNanchor_II-9" href="#Footnote_II-9" class="fnanchor">[II-9]</a> Other antiquities are reported
to exist at various points of the Isthmus, which white
men have never seen; instance a rocking stone in the
mountains of Veragua.<a id="FNanchor_II-10" href="#Footnote_II-10" class="fnanchor">[II-10]</a></p>

<p>I close my somewhat scanty information concerning
the antiquities of Chiriquí with the general remarks
which their examination has elicited from different
writers. Whiting and Shuman speak of the sculptured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
columns of Muerto Island as being similar to those in
Yucatan described by Stephens;<a id="FNanchor_II-11" href="#Footnote_II-11" class="fnanchor">[II-11]</a> but it is hardly probable
that this opinion rests on an actual comparison of
the hieroglyphics. Dr Merritt deems the axe or chisel
heads almost identical in form as well as material with
specimens dug up in Suffolk County, England; some
of the same implements resemble those seen by Mr
Squier in actual use among the natives of other parts
of Central America; while the arrow-heads and musical
instruments are pronounced different in some respects
from any others known, either ancient or
modern. The incised characters represented in the
cut on <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>, together with many others, if we may
believe Mr Seemann, have a striking resemblance to
those of Northumberland, England, as shown by Mr
Tate.<a id="FNanchor_II-12" href="#Footnote_II-12" class="fnanchor">[II-12]</a> In some of the terra cottas, a likeness to
vessels of Roman, Grecian, and Etruscan origin has
been noted; the golden figures, in the opinion of
Messrs Squier and May, being like those found further
south in the country of the ancient Muiscas.<a id="FNanchor_II-13" href="#Footnote_II-13" class="fnanchor">[II-13]</a></p>

<p>One point bearing on the antiquity of the Chiriquí
relics is the wearing away by the weather of the incised
sculptures, which appear to Mr Seemann to
belong to a more ancient, less advanced civilization
than those in low relief.<a id="FNanchor_II-14" href="#Footnote_II-14" class="fnanchor">[II-14]</a> Another is the disappearance
as a rule of human remains, which, however, as
Dr Torrey remarks,<a id="FNanchor_II-15" href="#Footnote_II-15" class="fnanchor">[II-15]</a> cannot in this climate and soil
be regarded as an indication of great age; and, moreover,
against the theory of a remote origin of these
relics, and in favor of the supposition that all may be
the work of the not distant ancestors of the people
found by the Spaniards in possession of the country,
we have the fact that gold figures similar to those
found in the huacas were made, worn, and traded by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the natives of the Isthmus at the time of its discovery
and conquest;<a id="FNanchor_II-16" href="#Footnote_II-16" class="fnanchor">[II-16]</a> that the animals so universally imitated
in all objects whether of gold, stone, or clay, are
all native to the country, with no trace of any effort
to copy anything foreign; and that similar clay is still
employed in the manufacture of rude pottery.<a id="FNanchor_II-17" href="#Footnote_II-17" class="fnanchor">[II-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">COSTA RICAN RELICS.</p>

<p class="p2">Costa Rica, adjoining Chiriquí on the west, is the
first or most southern of the states which belong politically
to North America, all the Isthmus provinces
forming a part of Colombia, a state of the southern
continent. Stretching from ocean to ocean with
an average width of ninety miles, it extends north-westward
in general terms some two hundred miles
from the Boca del Drago and Golfo Dulce to the Rio
de San Juan and the southern shores of Lake Nicaragua
in 11° north latitude. Few as are the aboriginal
monuments reported to exist within these limits, still
fewer are those actually examined by travelers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">IMPLEMENTS AND ORNAMENTS.</p>

<p>Drs Wagner and Scherzer, who traveled extensively
in this region in 1853-4, found in all parts of the state,
but more particularly in the Turialba Valley, which is
in the vicinity of Cartago, traces of old plantations of
bananas, cacao, and palms, indicating a more systematic
tillage of the soil, and consequently a higher general
type of culture among the former than are found
among the modern native Costa Ricans. The only
other antiquities seen by these intelligent explorers
were a few stone hammers thought to resemble implements
which have been brought to light in connection
with the ancient mines about Lake Superior; but the
locality of these implements is not stated. Cabo
Blanco, reported by Molina<a id="FNanchor_II-18" href="#Footnote_II-18" class="fnanchor">[II-18]</a> as containing the richest
deposit of ancient relics, yielded nothing whatever to
the diligent search of the German travelers; nor did
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
their failure here leave them sufficient faith to continue
their researches on the island of Chira, where, according
to the same authority, there are to be found ruined
aboriginal towns and tombs. At San José they were
told of figures of gold alloyed with copper which had
been melted at the government mint, and they briefly
mention hieroglyphics on a few ancient ornaments nowhere
described.<a id="FNanchor_II-19" href="#Footnote_II-19" class="fnanchor">[II-19]</a> Mr Squier describes five vessels
of earthen ware or terra cotta obtained, in localities not
mentioned, from Costa Rican graves. Four of these
are shown in the accompanying cut. Fig. 1, symmetrically
shaped, is entirely without decoration; Fig.
2 is a grotesque image supposed to have done duty
originally as a rattle; Fig. 3 has hollow legs, each containing
a small earthen ball, which rattles at each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
motion of the vase; and the top of Fig. 4 is artistically
moulded, apparently after the model of a tortoise's
back. An axe of green quartz is also described,
which to Mr Squier seemed to indicate a higher grade
of skill in workmanship than any relic of the kind
seen in Central America. The cutting edge is slightly
curved, showing the instrument to have been used as
an adze; the surface shown in the cut is
highly polished, and the whole is penetrated
by a small hole drilled from side to
side parallel to the face where the notches
appear. This implement seems to present
a rude representation of a human figure
whose arms are folded across its breast.
Other implements similar in material but
larger and of ruder execution, are said to
be of not unusual occurrence in the sepulchres
of this state.<a id="FNanchor_II-20" href="#Footnote_II-20" class="fnanchor">[II-20]</a></p>

<p>Mr Boyle makes the general statement that gold
ornaments and idols are constantly found, and that
the ancient mines which supplied the precious metal
are often seen by modern prospectors. Dr Merritt
also exhibited specimens of gold, both wrought and
unwrought, from the (ancient?) mines of Costa Rica,
at a meeting of the American Ethnological Society in
February, 1862.<a id="FNanchor_II-21" href="#Footnote_II-21" class="fnanchor">[II-21]</a> While voyaging on the Colorado,
the southern mouth of the Rio de San Juan, Mr Boyle
was told by a German doctor, his traveling companion,
of a wonderful artificial hill in that vicinity, but of
whose exact locality the doctor's ideas appeared somewhat
vague. On this hill, according to his statement,
was to be seen a pavement of slate tiles laid in copper;
but the interesting specimens which he claimed to have
collected in this neighborhood had been generously
presented by him to museums in various parts of the
world, and therefore he was unable to show any of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
them.<a id="FNanchor_II-22" href="#Footnote_II-22" class="fnanchor">[II-22]</a> Father Acuña, an enthusiastic antiquary of
the Rich Coast, living at Paraiso near Cartago, reports
an ancient road which he believes to have originally
connected Cartago with the port of Matina, and to
have formed part of a grand aboriginal system of highways
from the Nicaraguan frontier to the Isthmus,
with branches to various points along the Atlantic
coast. The road is described as thirty-six feet wide,
paved with rounded blocks of lava, and guarded at the
sides with sloping walls three feet in height. Where
the line of the road crossed deep ravines, bridges were
not employed, but in their stead the ascent and descent
were effected by means of massive steps cut in the
rocky sides. Some relics found near this road were
given to New York gentlemen. The priest also speaks
of tumuli abounding in the products of a past age,
which dot the plains of Terraba, once the centre, as he
believes, of a populous American empire.<a id="FNanchor_II-23" href="#Footnote_II-23" class="fnanchor">[II-23]</a> A channel
which connects the Rio Matina with Moin Bay has been
sometimes considered artificial, but Mr Reichardt pronounces
it probably nothing more than a natural lagoon.<a id="FNanchor_II-24" href="#Footnote_II-24" class="fnanchor">[II-24]</a>
In the department
of Guanacaste, near the
gulf of Nicoya, was found
the little frog in grey stone
shown, full-sized, in the cut.

it was worn suspended on a string as an ornament.<a id="FNanchor_II-25" href="#Footnote_II-25" class="fnanchor">[II-25]</a></p>

<p>Such is the meagre account I am able to give of
Costa Rican monuments. True, neither this nor any
others of the Central American states have been thoroughly
explored, nor are they likely to be for many
years, except at the few points where the world's commerce
shall seek new passages from sea to sea. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
difficulties are such as would yield only to a denser
population of a more energetic race than that now occupying
the land. The only monuments of the aboriginal
natives likely to be found are those buried in
the ancient graves. The probability of bringing to
light ruined cities or temples south of Honduras is
extremely slight. It is my purpose, however, to confine
myself to the most complete account possible of
such remains as have been seen or reported, with very
little speculation on probable discoveries in the future.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE MOSQUITO COAST.</p>

<p class="p2">Our next move northward carries us to Cape Gracias
á Dios on the Atlantic, and to the gulf of Fonseca
on the Pacific, the inclosed territory of Nicaragua
stretching some two hundred and fifty miles north-westward
to the Wanks River and Rio Negro, widening
in this distance from one hundred and fifty to about
three hundred miles. Dividing this territory by a
line along the central mountain ranges, or water-shed,
into two nearly equal portions, the western or Pacific
slope is the state of Nicaragua proper, while the eastern
or Atlantic side is known as the Mosquito Coast.
This latter region is almost entirely unexplored except
along the low marshy shore, and the natives of the
interior have always been independent of any foreign
control.</p>

<p>In respect of ancient remains the Mosquito Coast
has proved even more barren of results than Costa
Rica. A pair of remarkable granite vases preserved
in an English museum are said to have come from this
region, but as no particulars of their discovery are
given, it is of course possible, considering the former
unsettled condition of all Central American boundary
lines, not altogether remedied in later times, that
there may be an error in locality. It is from ten to
twelve inches in diameter and height, as nearly as can
be ascertained from the drawing, and Humboldt remarks
the similarity of its ornamentation to that
found on some parts of the ruins of Mitla in Oajaca,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
described in a future chapter. One of the vases as
represented in Humboldt's drawing, is shown in the
cut. The second vase is somewhat larger, more nearly
uniform in size at top and bottom, with plain legs,
only diamond-shaped ornaments on the body of the
vessel, and handles which take the form of a head and
tail instead of two heads as in the first specimen.<a id="FNanchor_II-26" href="#Footnote_II-26" class="fnanchor">[II-26]</a></p>

<p>Christopher Columbus in a letter speaks of having
seen on this coast, which he calls Cariay, a sculptured
tomb in the forest as large as a house; and Mr Helps
imagines the Spanish conquerors sailing up the coast
and beholding amidst the trees white structures "bearing
some likeness to truncated pyramids, and, in the
setting sun, dark figures would be seen against the
horizon on the tops of these pyramids;"<a id="FNanchor_II-27" href="#Footnote_II-27" class="fnanchor">[II-27]</a> but as he
is describing no particular voyage, some allowance
may be made for the play of his imagination. Mr
Boyle is enthusiastic over "the vast remains of a civilization
long since passed away," but far superior to
that of Spain, including rocks cut down to human and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
animal shapes, artificial hills encased in masonry,
streams turned from their courses, and hieroglyphic
sculptures on the cliffs,&mdash;all in the Mosquito wilds.
As a foundation for this, three men who descended the
Rio Mico and Blewfields River from Libertad, Nicaragua,
to the sea, claim to have beheld extraordinary
ancient works. These took the form of a cliff
cut away where the river passed through a narrow
cañon, leaving a group of stone animals, among which
was a colossal bear, standing erect on the brink of the
precipice as if to guard the passage. The natives reported
also to Mr Pim the existence of grand temples
of the antiguos, with an immense image of the aboriginal
god Mico (a monkey) on the banks of this
river; but when subjected to cross-questioning, their
wonderful stories dwindled to certain rude figures
painted on the face of a cliff, which Mr Pim was unable
to examine, but which seemed from the native
description similar to the cliff-paintings at Nijapa Lake
in Nicaragua, to be described on a future page.<a id="FNanchor_II-28" href="#Footnote_II-28" class="fnanchor">[II-28]</a></p>

<p>From a mound of earth fifteen feet in diameter, and
five or six feet high, on an island in Duckwarra Lagoon,
south of Cape Gracias á Dios, Mr Squier unearthed
a crumbling human skeleton, at whose head was a rude
burial vase containing chalcedony beads, two arrow-heads
of the same material, and the human
figure shown full-sized in the cut, fashioned
from a piece of gold plate. Antonio, an intelligent
Maya servant, could see no resemblance
in this figure to any relics of his race
in Yucatan. Two additional vases of coarse
earthen ware were discovered, but contained
no relics. On another occasion, during a
moonlight visit to the 'Mother of Tigers,' a
famed native <i>sukia</i>, or sorceress, on the Bocay,
which is a branch of the Wanks, about
fifty miles south-westward from Cape Gracias,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr Squier claims to have seen a ruined structure, part
of which is shown in the cut. The
building was of two stories, but the
upper walls had fallen, covering the
ground with fragments. It is described
as "built of large stones, laid with the
greatest regularity, and sculptured all
over with strange figures, having a close resemblance,
if not an absolute identity" with those drawn by Catherwood.
A short distance from the building stood
an erect stone rudely sculptured in human
form, facing east, as in the <a href="#i028b">cut</a>. There
are, however, some reasons for doubting
the accuracy of these Bocay discoveries,
notwithstanding the author's well-known
skill and reliability as an antiquarian,
since they were published under a nom
de plume, and in a work perhaps intended
by the writer as a fictitious narrative of
adventures.<a id="FNanchor_II-29" href="#Footnote_II-29" class="fnanchor">[II-29]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Across the dividing sierras, the Pacific slope, or
Nicaragua proper, has yielded plentiful monuments of
her former occupants, chiefly to the researches of two
men, Messrs Squier and Boyle. The former confined
his explorations chiefly to the region between the lakes
and ocean, while the latter has also made known the
existence of remains on the north-east of Lake Nicaragua,
in the province of Chontales.<a id="FNanchor_II-30" href="#Footnote_II-30" class="fnanchor">[II-30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CLASSIFICATION OF RELICS.</p>

<p>Although nothing like a thorough exploration of
the state has ever been made, yet the uniformity of
the remains discovered at different points enables us to
form a clear idea of the character, if not of the full
extent, of her antiquities, which for convenience in
description may be classified as follows: I. Mounds,
sepulchres, excavations, and other comparatively permanent
works; II. Figures painted or cut on rocks
or cliffs; III. Statues or idols of stone; IV. Stone
weapons, implements, and ornaments; V. Pottery;
VI. Articles of metal. Remarking that nowhere in
Nicaragua have traces of ruined cities been found, nor
even what may be regarded positively as the ruins of
temples or other buildings, I proceed to describe the
first class, or permanent monuments, beginning in the
south-west, following the coast region and lake islands
northward, and then returning to the south-eastern
province of Chontales.</p>

<p>First on the south are the cemeteries of Ometepec
Island, which is by some supposed to have been the
general burial place of all the surrounding country.
These cemeteries, according to Woeniger, are found in
high and dry places, enclosed by a row of rough flat
stones placed a few inches apart and projecting only
slightly above the surface of the ground. Friederichsthal
represents the sepulchres as three feet deep and
scattered at irregular intervals over a plain. Boyle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
found both fixed cemeteries fenced with a line of heavy
stones and also separate graves.<a id="FNanchor_II-31" href="#Footnote_II-31" class="fnanchor">[II-31]</a> Thus no burial
mounds proper seem to exist on the island. The ashes
or unburned bones of the dead are found enclosed in
large earthen vases, together with what may be considered
as the most valued property of the deceased,
or the most appropriate gifts of friends, in the shape
of weapons, ornaments, vessels, and implements of
stone, clay, and perhaps metal, all of which will be
described in their turn. When the burial urn is found
to contain unburned bones, its mouth is sometimes
closed with the skull; in other cases one or more inverted
earthen pans are used for that purpose.</p>

<p class="sidenote">EL BAÑO AT MASAYA.</p>

<p>On Zapatero, an island which lies just north of
Ometepec, distributed over a level space covered with
a dense growth of trees, are eight irregular heaps of
loose unhewn stones, showing no signs of system
either in the construction of each individual mound
or in their arrangement with reference to each other.<a id="FNanchor_II-32" href="#Footnote_II-32" class="fnanchor">[II-32]</a>
An attempt to open one of the largest of the number
led to no results beyond the discovery of an intermixture
of broken pottery in the mass of stones. They
are surrounded, as we shall see, by statues, and are
believed by Mr Squier to be remains of the teocallis
known to have served the Nicaraguans as temples at
the time of the conquest.<a id="FNanchor_II-33" href="#Footnote_II-33" class="fnanchor">[II-33]</a> At the foot of Mt Mombacho,
a volcano south of Granada, was found a ruined
cairn, or sepulchre, about twenty feet square, not particularly
described, but similar to those which will be
mentioned as occurring in the department of Chontales;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
others were said by the inhabitants to have
been found in the same vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_II-34" href="#Footnote_II-34" class="fnanchor">[II-34]</a> In a steep-banked
ravine near Masaya, the rocky sides of which present
numerous sculptured figures, or hieroglyphics, a shelf
some nine feet wide is cut in the perpendicular cliff
which towers one hundred feet in height at its back.
On this shelf is a rectangular excavation eight by four
feet and eighteen inches deep, with regularly sloping
and smoothly cut sides, surrounded by a shallow groove
which leads to the edge of the precipice, presumably
designed to carry off rain-water. This strange excavation
is popularly known as <span xml:lang="es">El Baño</span>, although hardly
of sufficient size to have served as a bath; a rudely cut
flight of steps leads up the cliff to the shelf, and two
pentagonal holes penetrate the face of the cliff at its
back horizontally to a great depth, but these may be
of natural formation. Some kettle-shaped excavations
are reported also along the shore of the lake, now and
possibly of old used in tanning leather.<a id="FNanchor_II-35" href="#Footnote_II-35" class="fnanchor">[II-35]</a> Mr Boyle
speaks of the road by which water is brought up from
the lake to the city by the women of Masaya, a deep
cut in the solid rock, a mile long and descending to a
depth of over three hundred feet, as a reputed work
of aboriginal engineering, but as he seems himself
somewhat doubtful of the fact, and as others do not
so mention it, this may not properly be included in
our list of ancient monuments.<a id="FNanchor_II-36" href="#Footnote_II-36" class="fnanchor">[II-36]</a> In the cliff at Nijapa,
an old crater-lake near Managua, is what has been regarded
by the natives as a wonderful temple excavated
from the solid rock by the labors of the Antiguos,
their ancestors. Indeed its entrance bears a strong
resemblance, when viewed from the opposite side of
the lake, to the arched portals of a heathen temple,
but, explored by both Squier and Boyle, it proved to
be nothing more than a natural cavern.<a id="FNanchor_II-37" href="#Footnote_II-37" class="fnanchor">[II-37]</a></p>

<p>Across the lake northward from Managua the volcano
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of Momotombo, projecting into the waters, forms
a bay in a locality once occupied traditionally by a
rich and populous city. If we may credit the Abbé
Brasseur de Bourbourg, its ruins are yet to be seen
beneath the waters of the bay.<a id="FNanchor_II-38" href="#Footnote_II-38" class="fnanchor">[II-38]</a> Captain Belcher visited
the country in 1838, and was told that a causeway
formerly extended across from the main to the
island of Momotombita, probably for the use of the
priests of ancient faith, since the island is rich in idols.
He even was able to see the remains of the causeway
extending in the dry season some three hundred and
sixty yards from the shore; but a closer examination
convinced Mr Squier that the supposed ruins were
simply a natural formation whose extreme hardness
had resisted better than the surrounding strata the
action of the waves.<a id="FNanchor_II-39" href="#Footnote_II-39" class="fnanchor">[II-39]</a></p>

<p>On the slope of a small bowl-shaped valley near
Leon is what the natives call the Capilla de la Piedra,
a natural niche artificially enlarged in the face of a
large rock facing the amphitheatre. It is spacious
enough to accommodate four or five persons, and a
large flat stone like an altar stands just at the entrance.
At Subtiava, an Indian pueblo near Leon, is
a stone mound, sixty by two hundred feet, and ten
feet high, very like those at Zapatero, except that in
this case the stones about the edges present some signs
of regularity in their arrangement. It is very probably
the ruin of some old temple-mound, and even in
modern days the natives are known to have secretly
assembled to worship round this stone-heap the gods
of their antiquity. Several low rectangular mounds
were also seen but not examined at the base of the
volcano of Orota, north-east of Leon.<a id="FNanchor_II-40" href="#Footnote_II-40" class="fnanchor">[II-40]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHONTAL BURIAL MOUNDS.</p>

<p>Returning to the south-eastern Chontal province,
the only well-attested permanent monuments are burial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
mounds or cairns of stone, although the Chevalier
Friederichsthal claims to have found here "remains
of ancient towns and temples," which, nevertheless,
he does not attempt to describe, and Mr Squier mentions
a traditionary ruined city near Juigalpa.<a id="FNanchor_II-41" href="#Footnote_II-41" class="fnanchor">[II-41]</a> The
cairns are found in the regions about the towns of
Juigalpa and Libertad, although exploration would
doubtless reveal their existence elsewhere in the province.
At both the places named they occur in great
numbers over a large area. "At Libertad," says Mr
Boyle, "graves were so plentiful we had only the embarrassment
of choice. Every hill round was topped
with a vine-bound thicket, springing, we knew, from
the cairn of rough stone reverently piled above some
old-world chieftain." No farther description can be
given of them than that they are rectangular embankments
of unhewn stone, built, in some cases at least,
with regularly sloping sides, and of varying dimensions,
the largest reported being one hundred and
twenty by one hundred and seventy-five feet, and five
feet high. Being opened they disclose earthen burial
urns containing, as at Ometepec, human remains, both
burned and unburned, and a great variety of stone and
earthen relics both within and without the cinerary
vase. The burial deposit is oftenest found above, but
sometimes also below, the original surface of the
ground. These cairns appear to have somewhat more
regularity, on the exterior at least, than the stone
tumuli of Ometepec. A more thorough examination
of both is necessary before it can be determined whether
or not the Ometepec mounds are, as Mr Squier believes,
the ruins of teocallis and not tombs, and whether
some of the Chontal cairns may not be the ruins or
foundations of ancient structures. There can be little
doubt that the Nicaraguans employed the mound-temple
in their worship, and it is somewhat remarkable
if modern fanaticism has left no traces of them;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
yet it is probable that wood entered more largely
into their construction than in more northern climes.
Mr Boyle found one grave near Juigalpa differing
from the usual Chontal method of interment, and
agreeing more nearly with that practiced in Mexico
and Ometepec; and Mr Pim mentions the occurrence
of numerous graves in the province, of much smaller
size and of different proportions, the largest being
twenty by twelve feet, and eight feet high.<a id="FNanchor_II-42" href="#Footnote_II-42" class="fnanchor">[II-42]</a></p>

<p>Near Juigalpa was seen a hill whose surface was
covered with stones arranged in circles, squares, diamonds,
and rays about a central stone;<a id="FNanchor_II-43" href="#Footnote_II-43" class="fnanchor">[II-43]</a> also a hill of
terrace-formation which from a distance seemed to be
an aboriginal fortification.<a id="FNanchor_II-44" href="#Footnote_II-44" class="fnanchor">[II-44]</a> In the same neighborhood
is reported a series of trenches stretching across
the country, one of them traced for over a mile, nine
to twelve feet wide, widening at intervals into oval
spaces from fifty to eighty feet in diameter, and these
enlargements containing alternately two and four small
mounds arranged in lines perpendicular to the general
direction of the trench.<a id="FNanchor_II-45" href="#Footnote_II-45" class="fnanchor">[II-45]</a> "Several rectangular parallelograms
outlined in loose stone," in the vicinity of Libertad,
are supposed by Mr Boyle to be Carib works,
not connected with the Chontal burial system.<a id="FNanchor_II-46" href="#Footnote_II-46" class="fnanchor">[II-46]</a></p>

<p>I come secondly to the hieroglyphic figures cut or
painted on Nicaraguan cliffs. These appear to belong
for the most part to that lowest class of picture-writing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
common throughout the whole length of the North
American continent, even in the territory of the most
savage tribes. Doubtless many of these figures were
executed in commemoration of events, and thus served
temporarily as written records; but it is doubtful if the
meaning of any of these inscriptions ever survived the
generation which originated them, and certain that
they are not understood by native or by antiquarian
at the present day. It is not unlikely that some of
them in Nicaragua may be rude representations of
deities, and thus identified with the same gods preserved
in stone, and with characters in the Aztec
picture-writings; but the picture-writing of the Nicaraguan
Nahuas, unlike that of their brethren of
Anáhuac, was not committed to paper during the first
years of the conquest, and has consequently been lost.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CLIFF-CARVINGS AT MASAYA.</p>

<p>At Guaximala a cave is mentioned having sculptures
on the rocks at its entrance. The natives dared
not cross the figured portal.<a id="FNanchor_II-47" href="#Footnote_II-47" class="fnanchor">[II-47]</a> In the ravine near
Masaya, already spoken of as the locality of the excavation
known as El Baño, the steep side-cliffs are
covered with figures roughly cut in outline, and often
nearly obliterated by the ravages of time. They are
shown in Squier's drawings on the following page, the
order in which the groups occur being preserved.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>Mr Squier detects among the objects thus rudely
delineated, the sun twice represented, a shield, arrows
or spears, the <i>Xiuhatlatli</i> of the Aztec paintings, which
is an instrument for hurling spears, and a monkey.
Besides the regular groups, isolated single figures are
seen, among which the two characters shown in the
accompanying cut are most frequently
repeated. The same vicinity is reported
to contain figures both painted and
cut in other localities.<a id="FNanchor_II-48" href="#Footnote_II-48" class="fnanchor">[II-48]</a></p>

<p>On the old crater-walls, five hundred feet in height
at the lowest point, which inclose Lake Nijapa, a few
miles south-west of Managua, are numerous figures
painted in red. Portions of the walls have been thrown
down by an earthquake, the débris at the water's
edge being covered with intricate and curious red
lines; and most of those still in place have been so
defaced by the action of wind and water that their
original appearance or connection cannot be distinguished.</p>

<p class="caption">Feathered Serpent at Lake Nijapa.</p>

<p>Among the clearest of the paintings is the coiled
feathered serpent shown in the cut. It is three feet
in diameter, across the coil, and is painted forty feet
up the perpendicular side of the precipice. This would
seem to be identical with the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, or
the Quiché Gucumatz, both of which names signify
'plumed serpent.' Of the remaining figures, shown
in the cut on the following page, the red hand is of
frequent occurrence here, and we shall meet it again
farther north, especially in Yucatan. The central
upper figure is thought by Mr Squier to resemble a

thrown down the sun and moon are said to have been
prominent.<a id="FNanchor_II-49" href="#Footnote_II-49" class="fnanchor">[II-49]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">STONE STATUES OR IDOLS.</p>

<p>Statues in stone, representing human beings generally,
but in some cases animals and monsters also,
have been found and described to the number of about
sixty, constituting our third and the most interesting
class of Nicaraguan relics. Ometepec, rich in pottery
and other relics, and reported also to contain idols, has
yielded to actual observation only the small animal
couchant represented in the cut.
It was secretly worshiped by the
natives for many years, even in
modern times, until this unorthodox
practice was discovered
and checked by zealous priests.
This animal idol was about fourteen
inches long and eight inches
in height.<a id="FNanchor_II-51" href="#Footnote_II-51" class="fnanchor">[II-51]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IDOLS ON ZAPATERO ISLAND.</p>

<p>The island of Zapatero has furnished some seventeen
idols, which are found in connection with the
stone-heaps already described, lying for the most part
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
wholly or partially buried in the sand and enveloped
in a dense shrubbery. It is not probable that any one
of them has been found in its original position, yet
such is their size and weight that they are not likely
to have been moved far from their primitive locality.
Indeed Mr Squier, with a large force of natives, transformed
into zealous antiquarians by a copious dispensation
of brandy, had the greatest difficulty in placing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
them in an upright position. An ancient crater-lake
conveniently near at hand accounts satisfactorily for
the almost entire absence of smaller idols, and would
doubtless have been the receptacle of their larger
fellow-deities, had the strength of the priestly iconoclasts
been in proportion to their godly spirit, as was
the case with Mr Squier's natives. As it was they
were obliged to content their religious zeal with overthrowing
and defacing as far as possible these stone
gods of the natives. There seems to be no regularity
or system in the arrangement of the statues
with respect to each other, and very little with respect
to the stone mounds. It is probable, however, that,
if the latter are indeed ruined teocallis, the statues
stood originally round their base rather than on their
summit. The idols of Zapatero, which is within the
limits of the Niquiran or Aztec province, are larger
and somewhat more elaborate in workmanship than
those found elsewhere; and the genital organs appear on
many of their number, indicating perhaps the presence
here of the wide-spread phallic worship. The cuts
show ten of the most remarkable of these monuments.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is nine feet high and about three feet in
diameter, cut from a solid block of black basalt. The
head of the human figure crouching on its immense
cylindrical pedestal forms a cross, a symbol not uncommon
here or elsewhere in America. All the work,
particularly the ornamental bands and the niches of
unknown use or import in front, is gracefully and
cleanly cut. Fig. 2 is a huge tiger eight feet high
seated on a pedestal. The heads and other parts of
different animals are often used in the adornment of
partially human shapes both in stone work and pottery,
but purely animal statues, intended as this apparently
is, for idols, are rare. Fig. 3, an idol "of mild and
benignant aspect" is shown in the leaning position in
which it was found. Fig. 4, standing in the background,

<p>Fig. 5 represents a statue which, with its pedestal,
is over twelve feet high. The well-carved head of a
monster, two feet eight inches broad, surmounts the
head of a seated human form, a common device in the
fashioning of Nicaraguan gods. A peculiarity of this
monument is that the arms are detached from the sides
at the elbows; free-sculptured limbs being of rare occurrence
in American aboriginal carvings. Fig. 6 is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
a slab three by five feet, bearing a human figure cut in
high relief, the only sculpture of this kind discovered
in Nicaragua. The tongue appears to hang upon the
breast, and the eyes are merely two round holes. Fig.
7, on the following page, represents a crouching human
form, on whose back is a tiger or other wild beast
grasping the head in its jaws, a favorite method
among these southern Nahua nations of representing
in stone and clay the characteristics of what are presumably
intended as beings to be worshiped. The
expression of the features in the human face is described
by Mr Squier as differing from any of the
others found in this group. This idol and the following,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>

<p>Fig. 9 is of very rude execution and seemingly represents
a human figure wearing an animal mask, which
is itself surmounted by another human face. Two
small cup-shaped smoothly cut holes are also noted in
the head-dress. Fig. 10 is a stone three feet and a
half high, but slightly modified by the sculptor's art,
which gave some semblance of the human form.</p>

<p>Two statues from Zapatero stand at the street-corners
of Granada; one, known as the Chiflador, is much
broken; the other has the crouching animal on the
human head. Another from the same island stands
by the roadside at Dirioma, near Granada, where it
serves as a boundary mark. According to Mr Boyle
this statue is of red granite, and it seemed to Mr
Squier more delicately carved than those at Zapatero.<a id="FNanchor_II-52" href="#Footnote_II-52" class="fnanchor">[II-52]</a>

<p>In the vicinity of the cairn already spoken of at the

with abundant fragments. One had what seemed a
monkey's head, with three female breasts and a phallus
among the complicated sculptures below; a rudely
cut animal bore some resemblance to a bear; a broken
figure is said by the natives to have represented, when
whole, a woman with a child on her back. One female
figure, of which there is no drawing, is pronounced by
Mr Boyle "very far the best-drawn statue we found in
Nicaragua." A sleeping figure with large ears, a natural
face, absurd arms, and a phallus, with the life-sized
corpse or sleeper of the cut complete the list.</p>

and "the whole expression grave and serene." The
colossal head shown in the cut on the preceding page
was among the other fragments found on the island,
where two groups of relics are said to exist, only one
of which has been explored.<a id="FNanchor_II-55" href="#Footnote_II-55" class="fnanchor">[II-55]</a></p>

<p>The Piedra de la Boca is a small statue, or fragment,
with a large mouth, standing at a street-corner
in Granada, having been brought from one of the lake
islands. The natives still have some feelings of dependence
on this idol in times of danger. Several
rudely carved, well-worn images stood also at the

<p>At the Indian pueblo of Subtiava near Leon many
idols were dug up by the natives for Mr Squier, eight
of them ranging from five and a half to eight feet in
height and from four to five feet in circumference.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
The natives have always been in the habit of making
offerings secretly to these gods of stone, and only a
few months before Mr Squier's visit a stone bull had
been broken up by the priests. About the large stone
mound before described are numerous fragments, but
only one statue entire, which is shown in Fig. 1. It
projects six feet four inches above ground and is cut
from sandstone. At the lower extremity of the flap
which hangs from the belt in front is noted a cup-like
hole large enough to contain about a quart. Fig. 2,
of the same material, is two feet six inches in height,
and represents a female either holding a mask over
her abdomen, or holding open the abdomen for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
face to look out. Fig. 3 and 4 show a front and
rear view of another statue, in
which the human face, instead
of being surmounted by, looks
out from the jaws of some animal.
The features of the face
had been defaced apparently by
blows with a hammer; the ornamentation
was thought to
resemble somewhat that of
the Copan statues. Others
mentioned and sketched at Subtiava
have a general resemblance
to these.<a id="FNanchor_II-57" href="#Footnote_II-57" class="fnanchor">[II-57]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IDOLS OF CHONTALES.</p>

<p>The Chontal statues are divided
by Mr Boyle into two
classes; the first of which includes
idols, with fierce and distorted
features, never found on
the graves, but often near them;
while the second is composed
of portrait-statues, always distinguished by closed eyes
and a calm, "simple, human air about their features,
however irregularly modeled." The latter are always
found on or in the cairns under which bodies are interred,
and are much more numerous than the idols
proper. Unfortunately we have but few drawings in
support of this theory. It is true that the two classes
of features are noticeable elsewhere, as well as here,
but the position of the statues does not seem to justify
any such division into portraits and idols. Mr Boyle
also believes the Chontal sculptures better modeled
though less elaborate than those of the south-west.<a id="FNanchor_II-58" href="#Footnote_II-58" class="fnanchor">[II-58]</a></p>

<p>Fig. 1 is one of several statues
found near Juigalpa; it is of the
portrait class, and is remarkable
for the wen over the eye and a
cross on the breast. Fig. 2 is the
head of another taken from a cairn
near Libertad, and since used to
prop up a modern wall. Fig. 3 is
what Mr Pim terms a head-stone
of one of the graves in the same
locality. Many of the images have
holes drilled through them; there
is no distinction of sex, and here,
as elsewhere, there is no attempt
at drapery. Entire statues seem
to be rare, but fragments very
abundant. Mr Squier notes in all
the Nicaraguan statues a general
resemblance, but at the same time
marked individuality, and deems it
possible to identify many of them
with the gods of the Mexican Pantheon.<a id="FNanchor_II-59" href="#Footnote_II-59" class="fnanchor">[II-59]</a></p>

<p>My fourth class includes weapons, implements, ornaments,
and other miscellaneous articles of stone. There
is a mention without description of arrow-heads and
flint flakes dug up from the graves of Ometepec.
Celts, much like those extant in European collections,
are reported as of frequent occurrence; two of granite
and one of basalt at Ometepec, and one of chipped
flint at Zapatero, the latter being regular in outline,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
with a smooth sharp edge, believed by Mr Boyle to
be of very rare form, and unique in America. Axes
are also said to be numerous, there being specially
mentioned one of basalt, broad and thin, from Ometepec;
and a similar one, three or four inches wide, six
inches long, and of a uniform thickness, not exceeding
one third of an inch, from Zapatero.</p>

from the Chontal cairns. It is of volcanic stone,
twelve and a half inches long by seven and three
fourths inches wide. Fig. 4 represents a flint axe

<p class="sidenote">STONE IMPLEMENTS AND ORNAMENTS.</p>

<p>Stone vessels are rare, though a granite vase, eighteen
inches high, as shown in the cut, was dug up at Brita,
near Rivas; and two marble vases of very superior
workmanship were found in a Libertad mound. One
was of the tripod form and badly broken; the other
was shaped like a can resting on a stand, with ornamental
handles, and having its sides, not thicker than
card-board, covered with grecs and arabesques.<a id="FNanchor_II-61" href="#Footnote_II-61" class="fnanchor">[II-61]</a></p>

<p>Metates occur often on both sides the lakes. The
cut on the following page shows one dug up at Leon,
being very similar to those still in use in the country,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
but more elaborate in its ornamentation. Those east
of the lakes are flat instead of curved, but still superior
to any now made, and in connection with them
have been found the pestles with which maize was
crushed.<a id="FNanchor_II-62" href="#Footnote_II-62" class="fnanchor">[II-62]</a></p>

<p>Broken pedestals and sculptured fragments whose
original purpose is unknown occur frequently, and
stone rattles were formerly found about Juigalpa.
Beads of lava, basalt, and chalcedony, in collections
suggestive of small necklaces, are numerous, particularly
at Ometepec. Those of lava are often wonderfully
wrought, about an inch long, ringed or grooved
on the surface, pierced lengthwise with a hole only
large enough to admit a fine thread, and yet the whole,
of the most brittle material, not thicker than twine.
Those of chalcedony are of larger size.<a id="FNanchor_II-63" href="#Footnote_II-63" class="fnanchor">[II-63]</a></p>

<p>The niche near Leon, known as the Capilla de la
Piedra, had before its entrance a flat stone resembling
an altar. At Zapatero Mr Squier found four stones
also apparently intended for sacrificial purposes. One
of these, an oval stone imbedded in the earth, and covered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
on its upper surface with inscribed characters, is
shown in the cut. Near the Simon mine in Nueva
Segovia, the north-eastern province of the state, was
found by Mr Pim a broken font, the only relic of this
region, on the exterior of which the following figure
is carved, supposed to represent the sun. It has also
the peculiarity of what seem intended for long moustaches.<a id="FNanchor_II-64" href="#Footnote_II-64" class="fnanchor">[II-64]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NICARAGUAN POTTERY.</p>

<p>The fifth class embraces all articles of pottery, abundant
throughout the whole extent of the state, but
especially so on the lake islands, where the natives actually
dig them from the earth to supply their present
needs. None of the localities which have yielded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
other relics is without its deposit of earthen ware,
either whole or in fragments. The fact that vessels
unearthed by the natives, when unbroken, are wholly
uninjured by their long rest under a damp tropical
soil, indicates their excellence in material and construction.
It is not indeed probable that in material
or methods of manufacture the ancient differed essentially
from the modern pottery; but in skill and taste
the former was unquestionably far superior. Mr
Squier pronounces the work equal to the best specimens
of the Mexican and Peruvian potters. He finds
no evidence of the use of the wheel; Mr Boyle, however,
thinks it was employed, but rarely. The clay
varies from brown to black, and the glazing, often
sufficiently thick to be chipped off with a knife, is
usually of a whitish or yellowish hue. The colors with
which most articles are painted are both brilliant and
durable, red being a favorite. In some cases the paint
seems to have penetrated the substance of the pottery,
as if applied before the clay was dry. The figures of
the cut illustrate the two
most common forms of the
cinerary, or burial, urns,
both from Ometepec, the
former sketched by Mr
Boyle and the latter by
Mr Squier. The urns contain
a black sticky earth
supposed to represent traces of burned flesh, and often
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
unburned bones, skull, or teeth, together with a collection
of the smaller relics which have been described.
The bones of animals, deer-horns, and boar-tusks, and
bone implements rarely or never occur. Earthen
basins of different material and color from the urns are
often&mdash;always in the Chontal graves&mdash;found inverted
one over another to close the mouth. The burial vases
are sometimes thirty-six inches long by twenty inches
high, painted usually on the outside with alternate
streaks of black and scarlet, while serpents or other
ornaments are frequently relieved on the surface. One
or two handles are in most cases attached to each.
Mr Squier believes a human skull to have been the
model of the urns. Five of them at Libertad are
noticed as lying uniformly east and west. It appears
evident that many of the articles found in or about
the graves had no connection with burial rites, some
of them having undoubtedly been buried to keep them
from the hands of the Spaniards. The figures of the
cuts, from Mr Boyle, show two forms of vessels which
are frequently repeated among an infinite variety of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
other shapes. The tripod vase with hollow legs is a
common form, of which Fig. 1 is a fine specimen from
Ometepec, five and three fourths inches high, and six
inches in diameter, with a different face on each leg.
Fig. 2 is a bowl from Zapatero which occurs in great
numbers, of uniform shape and decoration, but of varying
size, being ordinarily, however, ten inches in diameter
and four and one fourth inches high. Both inside
and outside are painted with figures which from their
uniformity in different specimens are deemed by Mr
Boyle to have some hidden hieroglyphic meaning. It
is also remarked that vessels intended to be of the
same size are exactly equal in every respect. Another
common vessel is a black jar, glazed and polished,
about four inches high and five and one fourth inches
in diameter, made of light clay, and having a simple
wavy ornament round the rim. Animals or parts of
animals, particularly alligators, often form a part of
the ornamentation of pottery, but complete animals in
clay are rare, a rude clay stag being the only relic of the
kind reported. The device of a beast springing on the
back of a human form, so frequent among the statues
or idols, also occurs in terra cotta. The four figures
of the cut show additional specimens in terra cotta
from Mr Squier, of which Fig. 2 is from Ometepec.<a id="FNanchor_II-65" href="#Footnote_II-65" class="fnanchor">[II-65]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS OF THE USE OF METALS.</p>

<p>It only remains to speak of the sixth and last class
of Nicaraguan relics; viz., articles of metal, which may
be very briefly disposed of. The only gold seen by any
of our authorities was "a drop of pure gold, one inch
long, precisely like the rattles worn by Malay girls,"
taken by Mr Boyle from a cinerary vase at Juigalpa.
But all others mention small gold idols and ornaments
which are reported to have been found, one of them
weighing twenty-four ounces; so that there can be but
little doubt that the ancient people understood to a
limited extent the use of this precious metal, which
the territory has never produced in large quantities.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Copper, on the contrary, is said to be abundant and of
a variety easily worked, and yet the only relic of this
metal discovered is the copper mask, which Mr Squier
supposes to represent a tiger's
face, shown in the cut. It
was presented to him by a man
who claimed to have obtained it
from Ometepec. Mr Boyle believes,
with reason as I think,
that in a country abounding in
the metal, the skill and knowledge
requisite to produce the
mask would most certainly have
left other evidences of its possession.
The authenticity of this
mask, when considered as a Nicaraguan
relic, may be regarded
as extremely problematical.<a id="FNanchor_II-66" href="#Footnote_II-66" class="fnanchor">[II-66]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Copper Mask.</p>
</div>

<p>Nicaraguan antiquities, concerning which I have
now given all the information in my possession, give
rise to but little discussion or visionary speculation.
Indeed there is little of the mysterious connected with
them, as they do not necessarily carry us farther back
into the past than the partially civilized people that
occupied the country in the sixteenth century. Not one
relic has appeared which may not reasonably be deemed
their work, or which requires the agency of an unknown
nation of antiquity. Yet supposing Nicaragua
to have been long inhabited by a people of only slightly
varying stages of civilization, any one of the idols described
may have been worshiped thousands of years
before the Spanish conquest. The relics are over
three hundred years old; nothing in themselves proves
them to be less than three thousand. Comparison
with more northern relics and history may fix their age
within narrower limits.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ANTIQUITIES OF SALVADOR.</p>

<p>Following the continent westward from Nicaragua,
we have the state of Salvador on the Pacific side,
stretching some one hundred and eighty miles from
the gulf of Fonseca to the Rio de Paza, the Guatemalan
boundary, and extending inland about eighty
miles. Here, in the central province of San Vicente,
a few miles southward from the capital city of the
same name, I find the first well-authenticated instance
in our progress northward of the occurrence of ruined
edifices. But of these ruins we only know that they
are the most imposing monuments in the state, covering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
nearly two square miles at the foot of the volcano
of Opico, and that they consist of "vast terraces,
ruins of edifices, and circular and square towers, and
subterranean galleries, all built of cut stones. A single
carving has been found here, on a block of stone
eight feet long by four broad. It is in the true Mexican
style, representing probably a prince or great warrior."<a id="FNanchor_III-1" href="#Footnote_III-1" class="fnanchor">[III-1]</a>
Several mounds, considerable in size and
regular in outline, were noted on the plain of Jiboa
west of San Vicente; also similar ones near Sonsonato
in the south-western portion of the state. In the north-west
on the Guatemalan boundary, aboriginal relics
are vaguely reported on the islands of Lake Guijar, but
of them nothing is known.<a id="FNanchor_III-2" href="#Footnote_III-2" class="fnanchor">[III-2]</a> And concerning Salvador
monuments nothing further is to be said, although Mr
Squier heard of ruins in that state rivaling in extent
and interest the famous Copan.<a id="FNanchor_III-3" href="#Footnote_III-3" class="fnanchor">[III-3]</a></p>

<p class="p2">On the other side of the continent, reaching also
across to the Pacific at the gulf of Fonseca, north of
Nicaragua, the Mosquito coast, and Salvador, is the
state of Honduras. It extends over three hundred
and fifty miles westward along the Atlantic shore, from
Cape Gracias á Dios nearly to the narrowest point of
the isthmus where America is a second time so nearly
cut in twain by the gulfs of Honduras and Dulce.
The mountain chains which skirt the valley of the
Motagua on the south, known as the sierras of Grita,
Espíritu Santo, Merendon, Copan, etc., form the
boundary line between Honduras and Guatemala.
The northern coast, closely resembling in its general
character the Mosquito shore, has preserved along its
marshy lagoons, so far as they have been explored, no
traces of its early occupants. Yet on the coast islands
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
some relics appear. On that of Guanaja, whence in
1502 Columbus first beheld the continent of North
America, is reported a wall of considerable extent, only
a few feet high, with three-legged stone chairs fixed at
intervals in rude niches or fissures along its sides.
Chair-shaped excavations in solid rock occur at several
other points on the island, together with rudely molded
but fantastically decorated vessels of earthen ware.
The Guanaja remains are chiefly found in the vicinity of
the Savanna Bight Kay.<a id="FNanchor_III-4" href="#Footnote_III-4" class="fnanchor">[III-4]</a> On the neighboring island
of Roatan fragments of aboriginal pottery and small
stone idols are found scattered through the forest.<a id="FNanchor_III-5" href="#Footnote_III-5" class="fnanchor">[III-5]</a></p>

<p>The eastern interior of Honduras, by reason of its
gold mines, has been more extensively explored than
the Mosquito region farther south; yet with respect
to the departments of Olancho and Tegucigalpa I only
find the statement by Mr Wells that "mounds containing
specimens of ancient pottery are often met
with by the <i>vaqueros</i> while exploring the gloomy
depths of the forest, but these seldom survive the
destructive curiosity of the natives;" this chiefly in
the valleys of Agalta and Abajo, and on the hacienda
of Labranza. The pottery takes the form of pans
and jars to the number of ten to thirty in each mound;
no idols or human remains having been reported.<a id="FNanchor_III-6" href="#Footnote_III-6" class="fnanchor">[III-6]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COMAYAGUA RELICS.</p>

<p>Still farther west, in the valley of Comayagua, midway
between the oceans, about the head-waters of the
rivers, to which the names Ulua, Goascoran, and Choluteca
are applied as often as any others on the maps,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
there are abundant works of the former natives, made
known, but unfortunately only described in part, by
Mr Squier. These works chiefly occur on the terraces
of the small branch valleys which radiate from that
of Comayagua as a centre, in localities named as follows:
Chapulistagua, Jamalteca, Guasistagua, Chapuluca,
Tenampua, Maniani, Tambla, Yarumela, Calamulla,
Lajamini, and Cururu. The ruins are spoken
of in general terms as consisting of "large pyramidal,
terraced structures, often faced with stones, conical
mounds of earth, and walls of stone. In these, and in
their vicinity, are found carvings in stone, and painted
vases of great beauty." Concerning most of the localities
mentioned we have no further details, and must
form an idea of their nature from the few that are
partially described, since a similarity is apparent between
all the monuments of the region.</p>

<p>About Comayagua, or Nueva Valladolid, we are
informed that "hardly a step can be taken in any direction
without encountering evidences of aboriginal occupation,"
the only relic specified, however, being a stone
idol of canine form now occupying a position in the walls
of the church of Our Lady of Dolores. At Tambla,
some leagues south-east of Comayagua, was found the
fossil skeleton of a mastodon, whose tooth is shown in
the cut, imbedded in a sandstone formation.<a id="FNanchor_III-7" href="#Footnote_III-7" class="fnanchor">[III-7]</a> One of the
stratified sandstone terraces of
the sierra south-west of Comayagua
forms a fertile table
over three thousand feet above
the level of the sea; and on
its surface, in an area of ten
or twelve acres inclosed by a
spring-fed mountain stream,
are the ruins of Calamulla, consisting simply of
mounds. Of these, two are large, one about one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
feet long, with two stages, having a flight of
steps on the western slope. It shows clear traces of
having been originally faced with flat stones, now for
the most part removed. Most of the mounds are of
earth in terraces, and some of rectangular outline have
a small conical mound raised a few feet above the
surface of their upper platform. Stone-heaps of irregular
form also occur; perhaps places of sepulture;
at least differing in their use from the tumuli of more
regular outlines which may readily be imagined once
to have supported superimposed structures of more
perishable materials. The natives have traditions,
probably unfounded, of subterranean chambers and
galleries beneath this spot. In the same vicinity,
near the banks of the Rio Chiquinguare, and about a
league from the pueblo of Yarumela, is another group
of mounds, lying partly in the forest and partly in
lands now under native cultivation. These remains,
although in a more advanced state of ruin, are very
similar to those of the Calamulla group. It is noted,
however, that the tumuli are carefully oriented, and
that some have stone steps in the centre of each side.
In one or two cases there even remained standing
portions of cut-stone walls. Local tradition, which as
a rule amounts to nothing in such cases, seems to indicate
that these structures were already in a ruined
state before the Spanish conquest. At the town of
Yarumela, and presumably taken from the group described,
were seen, besides a few curiously carved
stones, six earthen vases of superior workmanship and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
design, one of which is represented in the cut, together
with separate and enlarged portions of its ornamentation,
which is both carved and painted. The flying
deity painted in outline on one of its faces is pronounced
by Mr Squier identical with one of the characters
of the Dresden Codex.<a id="FNanchor_III-8" href="#Footnote_III-8" class="fnanchor">[III-8]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF TENAMPUA.</p>

<p>At Tenampua, or Pueblo Viejo, twenty miles south-east
of Comayagua, near Flores, is a hill of white
stratified sandstone, whose sides rise precipitously to
a height of sixteen hundred feet above the level of the
surrounding plain. The summit forms a level plateau
one half a mile wide and one mile and a half long
from east to west. On the eastern half chiefly, but
also spreading over the whole surface of this lofty
plateau, is the most extensive group of ancient works
in the whole region, and in fact the only one of which
we have a description at all in detail. As in the other
localities of this part of the state, the group is made
up for the most part of rectangular oriented mounds,
some of stone, but most of earth, with a stone facing.
The smaller mounds are apparently arranged in groups
according to some system; they vary in size from
twenty to thirty feet in height, having from two to
four stages. The larger pyramidal tumuli are from
sixty to one hundred feet long and of proportionate
width and altitude, with in many cases a flight of
steps in the centre of the side facing the west.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i074"></a>

<p class="caption">Enclosure at Tenampua.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF TENAMPUA.</p>

<p>The structures that have been described are as follows,
it being understood that they are but a part of
the whole: A mound located on the very edge of the
southern precipice commands a broad view over the
whole plain of Comayagua, and its position suggests
its possible aboriginal use as a station for fire-signals.
Just north of this is an excavation, or perhaps a small
natural valley, whose sides are faced with stone in
steps leading up the slope on all four sides. In the
centre of the eastern half of the plain, and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
in the midst of the principal ruins, is what
may be regarded as the chief structure of the group,
commanding a view of all the rest. The annexed cut,
made up from the description, will aid in giving a clear
idea of the work. Two stone walls, an outer and an
inner, about ten feet apart, each two feet thick, of
which only a few feet in height remain standing, enclose
a rectangular area of one hundred and eighty by
three hundred feet. Cross-walls at regular intervals
divide the space between the two into rectangular
apartments now filled with earth to a depth of two
feet. The walls terminate on the western side in two
oblong terraced mounds between which is the only entrance
to the enclosure; while on the opposite side in
a corresponding position on the eastern wall is a mound
equal in bulk to both the western ones combined.
Within the inclosure is a large pyramidal mound in
three stages, with a flight of steps on the west, situated
just south of a central east and west line. From
its south-west corner a line of imbedded stones runs
to the southern wall; and between the pyramid and
the gateway is a small square of stones. A similar
mound, also provided with a stairway, is found in the
north-east corner of the enclosure. The stones of
which the walls and facings are made, indeed of all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the stone work at Tenampua, are not hewn, but very
carefully laid, no mention being made of mortar. All
the structures are carefully oriented. At the south-east
corner of the plateau is a second enclosure which
has a gateway in the centre of each of its four equal
sides, but whose dimensions are not given. This
has in its area two mounds, each with a stairway.
Elsewhere, its location on the plateau not being stated,
is a raised terrace, or platform, three hundred and sixty
feet long, containing one of the most remarkable features
of the place, in the form of two parallel mounds
one hundred and forty feet long, thirty-six feet wide
at the base, ten feet high, and forty feet apart at their
inner and lower edges. The outer sides have double
walls like those of the chief enclosure, divided into
three compartments, and having served apparently as
the foundations of three separate buildings. The
inner side of each mound slopes in three terraces, the
lower ones being faced with large flat stones set upright.
In a line with the centre between these parallels
and at a distance of one hundred and twenty paces
is a mound with a stairway on its southern slope, and
at a distance of twenty-four paces on the same line,
but in a direction not stated, are two large stones carefully
placed with a space of one foot between them.
The conjectural use of these parallels, like that of
somewhat similar ones which we shall meet elsewhere,
is for the accommodation of the ancient nobility or
priesthood in their games or processions. On the
west end of the plateau are two perpendicular excavations
in the rock, twenty feet square and twelve feet
deep, with a gallery three feet square leading northward
from the bottom of each. The natives have an
idea that these passages lead to the ruins of Chapulistagua,
but they are probably of natural formation
with artificial improvements, and of no great extent.
The remains of a pyramid are found in the vicinity of
the holes. Near the centre of the plateau, in a spot
naturally low and marshy, are two large square excavations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
which may have been reservoirs. In addition
to the works described are over three hundred mounds
or truncated pyramids of different sizes, scattered over
the surface of the plateau, to the location and arrangement
of which, in the absence of a plan, we have no
guide. They are covered with a heavy growth of
timber, some of them supporting pine-trees two feet
in diameter. Only one was opened and its interior
found to consist simply of earth, except the upper terrace
which was ashes and burned matter, containing
fragments of pottery and of obsidian knives. The
pottery is chiefly in the form of small flat pans and
vases, all decorated with simple painted figures; and
one small gourd-shaped vase, nearly entire, was filled
with some black indurated matter so hard as not to
be removable. As to the original purposes to which
the structures of Tenampua were devoted, speculation
points with much plausibility to religious ceremonies
and temples in the case of the enclosures and larger
pyramids; to sepulchral rites in that of the smaller
mounds; while the strong natural position of the
works on a plateau with high, precipitous, and at nearly
every point inaccessible sides, indicates that defense
was an important consideration with the builders. The
supposed reservoirs favor this theory, which is rendered
a certainty by the fortifications which protect the
approach to the plateau at the only accessible points,
on three narrow ridges connecting this hill with others
of the range. These fortifications are walls of rough
stone, from six to fifteen feet high and ten to twenty
feet thick at the base, according to the weakness or
strength of the location. Gullies on the slopes which
might afford a cover for approaching foes are carefully
filled with stones; and the walls themselves, which also
have traces of towers at intervals, while presenting a
perpendicular exterior, are terraced on the inside for
the convenience of the defenders. Yet the poor thin
soil, incapable of supporting a large number of people,
indicates that it was not probably a fortified town, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
that it must be regarded as a place sacred to the gods,
to be defended to the last, and possibly a refuge for
the people of the towns below in cases of extreme
danger.<a id="FNanchor_III-9" href="#Footnote_III-9" class="fnanchor">[III-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CLIFF-CARVINGS OF ARAMACINA.</p>

<p>Southward from Comayagua, toward the Pacific
shore, we find relics of former times near Aramacina,
in the Goascoran region. Here the smooth vertical
face of a sandstone ledge forms one side of a natural
amphitheatre, and is covered, for a space of one hundred
by fifteen feet, with engraved figures cut to a
depth of two and a half inches, the incisions serving
as convenient steps by which to mount the cliff. Some
of the engravings have been destroyed by modern
quarry-men; of those remaining some seem to be ornamental
and arbitrary, while in others the forms of
men and animals may be distinguished. They are
pronounced by the observer identical in style with
the inscriptions of Nicaragua and Salvador, of whose
existence in the latter state we have no other intimation.<a id="FNanchor_III-10" href="#Footnote_III-10" class="fnanchor">[III-10]</a></p>

<p class="p2">But one group of antiquities in Honduras remains
to be described,&mdash;Copan, the most wonderful of all,
and one of the most famous of American ruins. The
location is in a most fertile tobacco-producing region
near the Guatemalan boundary, on the eastern bank
of the Rio Copan, which flows northward to join the
Motagua some fifty miles below the ruins, at a point
something more than one hundred miles above its
mouth in the bay of Honduras.<a id="FNanchor_III-11" href="#Footnote_III-11" class="fnanchor">[III-11]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Some rapids occur in the Copan River below the
ruins, but in the season of high water it is navigable
for canoes for a greater part of its course. The name
Copan, so far as can be known, was applied to the
ruins simply from their vicinity to an adjacent hamlet
or Indian pueblo so named, which is located at the
mouth of a small stream, called Sesesmil by Col. Galindo,
which empties into the Copan a little higher
up. This pueblo has greatly deteriorated in later
times; formerly both town and province were rich
and prosperous. Indeed, in the sixteenth century, in
the revolt which broke out soon after the first conquest,
the cacique of Copan resisted the Spanish forces
long after the neighboring provinces had been subdued.
Driven eventually to his chief town, he opposed
barricades and ditches to the advancing foe, but
was at last forced after a desperate struggle to yield
to Hernando de Chaves in 1530. It was formerly
supposed that the place where he made his brave
stand against Chaves was identical with the ancient
city since called Copan, its ruin dating from its fall in
1530. It is now believed, however, that there was
no connection whatever between the two, and that, so
far as the ruined city of antiquity is concerned, history
is absolutely silent. This conclusion is based on the
facts that Cortés in his famous march through Honduras
in 1524, although passing within a few leagues of
this place, heard nothing of so wonderful a city, as he
could hardly have failed to do had it been inhabited
at the time; that there is not the slightest resemblance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
between the ruined structures to be described
in these pages and the town besieged by Chaves as
reported in the chronicles of the period; and above all
that the ruins are described by Palacio as being very
nearly in their present state, with nothing but the
vaguest traditions respecting their origin, only about
forty years after the fall of the brave cacique, the latter
fact, however, not having been known to those
authors who have stated that Copan was inhabited at
the conquest.<a id="FNanchor_III-12" href="#Footnote_III-12" class="fnanchor">[III-12]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">EXPLORATION OF THE RUINS.</p>

<p>This region has never been really explored with a
view to the discovery of ancient relics. The few visitors,
of whose explorations I give the history and
bibliography in full in the annexed note,<a id="FNanchor_III-13" href="#Footnote_III-13" class="fnanchor">[III-13]</a> have found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
enough of the wonderful in the monuments known to
exist since the sixteenth century, without pushing their
investigations back into the dense and almost impenetrable
forest away from the immediate banks of the
river. The difficulty attending antiquarian research
in a country where the whole surface is covered with
so dense a growth that progress in any direction is
possible only foot by foot with the aid of the native
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
machete, may be imagined. A hot climate, a moist
and malarious atmosphere, venomous serpents and reptiles,
myriads of diminutive demons in the form of
insects, all do most vigorous battle against the advances
of the foreign explorer, while the apathetic
natives, whether of American or Spanish blood, feel
not the slightest enthusiasm to unveil the mysterious
works of the antiguos.</p>

<p>For what is known of Copan the world is indebted
almost entirely to the works of the American traveler,
Mr John L. Stephens, and of his most skilful artist-companion,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr F. Catherwood;<a id="FNanchor_III-14" href="#Footnote_III-14" class="fnanchor">[III-14]</a> and from the works
of these gentlemen, with the slight notes to be gleaned
from other sources, I proceed to give all that is known
of what is commonly termed the oldest city on the
American continent. I will begin by giving Juarros'
description in full, since few or none of the objects
mentioned by him can be identified with any of those
met in the following pages. "In the year 1700, the
Great Circus of Copan, still remained entire. This
was a circular space, surrounded by stone pyramids
about six yards high, and very well constructed; at
the bases of these pyramids were figures, both male
and female, of very excellent sculpture, which then
retained the colours they had been enamelled with;
and, what was not less remarkable, the whole of them
were habited in the Castilian costume. In the middle
of this area, elevated above a flight of steps, was the
place of sacrifice. The same author (Fuentes) relates
that, at a short distance from the Circus, there was a
portal constructed of stone, on the columns of which
were the figures of men, likewise represented in Spanish
habits, with hose, ruff round the neck, sword, cap,
and short cloak. On entering the gateway there are
two fine stone pyramids, moderately large and lofty,
from which is suspended a hammock that contains two
human figures, one of each sex, clothed in the Indian
style. Astonishment is forcibly excited on viewing
this structure, because, large as it is, there is no appearance
of the component parts being joined together;
and, although entirely of stone, and of an enormous
weight, it may be put in motion by the slightest impulse
of the hand. Not far from this hammock is the
cave of Tibulca; this appears like a temple of great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
size, hollowed out of the base of a hill, and adorned
with columns having bases, pedestals, capitals and
crowns, all accurately adjusted according to architectural
principles; at the sides are numerous windows
faced with stone exquisitely wrought. All these circumstances
lead to a belief that there must have been
some intercourse between the inhabitants of the old
and new world at very remote periods."<a id="FNanchor_III-15" href="#Footnote_III-15" class="fnanchor">[III-15]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">EXTENT OF THE RUINS.</p>

<p>The ruins are always spoken of as extending two
miles along the bank of the river; yet all the structures
described or definitely located by any visitor, are
included in the much smaller area shown on Mr
Stephens' plan, with, however, the following exceptions:
"A stone wall with a circular building and a
pit, apparently for a reservoir," is found about a mile
up the river; the quarry which supplied material for
all the structures and statues,&mdash;a soft grit interspersed
with hard flinty lumps,&mdash;is in a range of hills two miles
north of the river, where are scattered many blocks
rejected by the ancient workers, one being seen on the
very top of the range, and another, the largest noted,
half-way between the quarry and its destination at
the ruins; Fuentes' wonderful cave of Tibulca is in
the same range of hills, and may be identical with
the quarry, or, as Col. Galindo thinks, with a natural
cave in a mountain two leagues distant; one monument
is mentioned at a distance of a mile across the
river on the summit of a mountain two thousand feet
high, but this does not appear to have been visited;
and finally, the natives reported to Mr Hardcastle a
causeway in the forest, several leagues in length.
Yet although so very little is known of outside monuments,
there can be no doubt that such exist, not improbably
of great extent and interest; since, although
heaps of ruins and fragments are vaguely reported in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
every direction, no attempt at a thorough examination
has ever been made or indeed could be, except by removing
the whole forest by a conflagration during the
dry season.<a id="FNanchor_III-16" href="#Footnote_III-16" class="fnanchor">[III-16]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The plan on the opposite page shows the ruins in
their actual state, according to Mr Stephens' survey,
together with a restoration to what seems to have been
something like their original condition. The union of
the two effects in one plate is, I believe, a sufficient
reason for indulging to this extent in a fancy for restoration,
justly condemned by antiquarians as a rule.<a id="FNanchor_III-17" href="#Footnote_III-17" class="fnanchor">[III-17]</a></p>

<p>Returning then to the limits of the plan, we find
portions of a wall, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, which when entire, as indicated
by the dotted lines, seems to have enclosed a
nearly rectangular area, measuring in general terms
900 by 1600 feet. Whatever treasures of antiquity
may be hid in the depths of the forest, there can be
but little doubt that this enclosure embraced the leading
structures or sacred edifices of the ancient town.
These walls would seem at least twenty-five feet thick
at the base, and are built, like all the Copan structures,
of large blocks of cut stone, of varying but not
expressly stated dimensions. They are built, in parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
at least, in terraces or steps, and painted. Only one
authority speaks of the use of mortar.<a id="FNanchor_III-18" href="#Footnote_III-18" class="fnanchor">[III-18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GREAT TEMPLE.</p>

<p>In the north-west corner of the enclosure, nearly
filling its northern half, is the chief structure which
has been called the Temple. Its dimensions are 624
feet north and south by 809 feet east and west.<a id="FNanchor_III-19" href="#Footnote_III-19" class="fnanchor">[III-19]</a>
From the remains the Temple in its original state is
seen to have been an immense terrace, with sides
sloped toward the land but perpendicular on the
river, on the platform of which were both pyramidal
elevations and sunken courts of regular rectangular
outlines. The river wall, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, rises perpendicularly to a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
height, in its present ruined state, of from sixty to ninety
feet, and the annexed cut gives its appearance from
the opposite side of the river; but the original elevation
of the terrace overlooking the river, judging from
portions still intact, was about a hundred feet, some
twenty-five or thirty feet of this elevation, at least at the
northern end, being, however, the height of the original
bank above the water; so that the terrace-platform of
the whole Temple, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, must have been about seventy
feet above the surface of the ground. The whole
is built of cut stone in blocks a foot and a half wide by
three to six feet long, and, without taking into account
the excess of superimposed pyramids over sunken
courts, must have required in round numbers over twenty-six
million cubic feet of stone in its construction.<a id="FNanchor_III-20" href="#Footnote_III-20" class="fnanchor">[III-20]</a></p>

<p>The land sides on the north, east, and south, slope by
steps of about eighteen inches each to a height of from
thirty to 140 feet according as they are more or less fallen,
extending also in some parts to the general level
of the terrace-platform, and in others reaching in
one incline to the top of the upper pyramids, E, E.<a id="FNanchor_III-21" href="#Footnote_III-21" class="fnanchor">[III-21]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
On the main platform are two sunken rectangular
courts, marked on the plan A and B, whose floors
or pavements seem to be about forty feet above the
surface of the ground, and thirty feet below the level of
the terrace. The court A is ninety by 144 feet, and
ascends on all sides in regular steps like a Roman amphitheatre.
The west side ascends in two flights each
of fifteen steps, separated by a terrace twelve feet wide,
to the platform overlooking the river, on which, at <i>i</i>, are
the ruins of what were apparently two circular towers.
From a point half-way up the steps a passage or gallery
<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, just large enough to afford passage to a
crawling man, leads horizontally through to the face
of the river-wall, the opening in which, visible from
the opposite bank, has given to the ruins the name
among the natives of Las Ventanas. Just below the
entrance to this gallery, at <i>o</i>, is a pit five feet square, and
seventeen feet deep, from the bottom of which a passage
leads into a vault five feet wide, ten feet long, and four
feet high, which, according to Col. Galindo's measurement,
is twelve feet below the pavement of the court;
the opening into this pit, at <i>o</i>, seems however to have
been made by Galindo by excavation. The entrance
to the court A is by the passage-way, C, C, from the
north, the floor of which is on a level with that of the
court. Similar steps lead up to the river-terrace on
the west, while the pyramid D on the east rises to a
height of 122 feet on the slope in steps or stages each
six feet high and nine feet wide. The passage-way is
thirty feet wide and over 300 feet long, and it seems
probable that a flight of steps originally led up to the
level of its entrance at <i>p</i>. The Court B is larger,
but its steps are nearly all fallen, and it is now only
remarkable for its altar, which will be described elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_III-22" href="#Footnote_III-22" class="fnanchor">[III-22]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>As I have said, all the steps and sides bear evident
traces of having been originally painted. The whole
structure is enveloped in a dense growth of shrubs and
trees, which have been the chief agents in its ruin,
penetrating every crevice with their roots and thus
forcing apart the carefully laid superficial stones. Two
immense ceiba-trees over six feet in diameter, with
roots spreading from fifty to one hundred feet, are
found on the summit of the lofty pyramid D.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PYRAMIDS AT COPAN.</p>

<p>Besides the temple, there are three small detached
pyramids, I, F, G, the former fifty feet square and thirty
feet high, between the last two of which there seems
to have been a gateway, or entrance, to the enclosure.
There are moreover the terraced walls <i>v</i>, <i>v</i>, of the
plan, which require no additional description, but
which extend for an unknown distance eastward into
the forest. There are also shapeless heaps of fallen
ruins scattered in every direction.<a id="FNanchor_III-23" href="#Footnote_III-23" class="fnanchor">[III-23]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">STATUES OR IDOLS.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SCULPTURED OBELISK.</p>

<p>Next to the ruined Temple in importance, or even
before it as an indication of the artistic skill of its builders,
are the carved obelisks, statues, or idols, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
peculiar to this region, but remarkably similar to each
other. Fourteen of these are more or less fully described,
most of them standing and in good preservation, but
several of this number, and probably many besides,
fallen and broken. Their positions are shown on the
plan by the numbers 1 to 14. It will be noticed that
only one is actually within the structure known as
the Temple, three standing at the foot of its outer terrace
within the quadrangle H, and the remainder in a
group at the southern part of the enclosure, two of the
latter being at the foot of terraced walls. These
statues are remarkable for their size and for their complicated
and well-executed sculpture. Of the eight
whose dimensions are given, the smallest, No. 13, is
eleven feet eight inches high, three feet four inches
wide and thick; and the largest, Nos. 2 and 3, are
thirteen feet high, four feet wide, and three feet thick.
The material is the same soft stone taken from the
quarry which furnished the blocks for building the
walls. As to their position, Nos. 3, 11, and 13 face
toward the east; Nos. 1, 5, and 9, toward the west;
and No. 10 toward the north; the others are either
fallen or their position is not given. No. 1 is smaller
at the bottom than at the top, and Col. Galindo mentions
two others, on hills east and west of the city,
which have a similar form; all the rest are of nearly
uniform dimensions throughout their length. Several
rest on pedestals from six to seven feet square, and
No. 13 has also a circular stone foundation sixteen feet
in diameter. In each a human face occupies a central
position on the front, having in some instances something
that may be intended to represent a beard and
moustache. The faces are remarkably uniform in the
expression of their features, generally calm and pleasant;
but in the case of No. 11 the partially open
lips, and eye-balls starting from their sockets, indicate
a design on the part of the artist to inspire terror in
the beholder of his work. The hands rest in nearly
every instance back to back on the breast. The dress
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and decoration seem to indicate that some were intended
for males, others for females; this and the
presence or absence of beard are the only indications
of sex observable. The feet are mostly dressed in
sandals, as shown clearly in the cut from No. 7.
Above and round the head is a complicated mass of
the most elaborate ornamentation, which utterly defies
verbal description. Mr Stephens notes something
like an elephant's trunk among the decorations of No.
8. The sides and usually the backs are covered with
hieroglyphics arranged in square tablets, which probably
contain, as all observers are impelled to believe,
the names, titles, and perhaps history of the beings
whose images in stone they serve to decorate. The
backs of several, however, have other figures in addition
to the supposed hieroglyphics, as in No. 8, where
is a human form sitting cross-legged; and in No. 10,
in which the characters seem to be human in a variety
of strange contortions, although arranged in tablets
like the rest; and No. 13 has a human face in the
centre of the back as well as front. The sculpture is
all in high relief, and was originally painted red, traces

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of the color being well preserved in places protected
from the action of the weather. I give cuts of two
of these carved obelisks, Nos. 3, and 6, to illustrate as
fully as possible the general appearance of these most
wonderful creations of American art, the details and
full beauties of which can only be appreciated in the
large and finely engraved plates of Catherwood.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRIFICIAL ALTARS.</p>

<p>Standing from six to twelve feet in front of nine of
the fourteen statues, and probably of all in their primitive
state, are found blocks of stone which, apparently,
can only have been employed for making offerings or
sacrifices in honor of the statues, whose use as idols
is rendered nearly certain by the uniform proximity of
the altars. The altars are six or seven feet square
and four feet high, taking a variety of forms, and
being covered with sculpture somewhat less elaborate
than the statues themselves, often buried and much
defaced. Two of them, belonging to Nos. 10 and 7,
are shown in the accompanying cuts. The former is
five and a half feet in diameter, and three feet high,
with two grooves in the top; the latter seven feet square
and four feet high, supposed to represent a death's
head. The top of the altar accompanying No. 9 is
carved to represent the back of a tortoise; that of
No. 13 consists of three heads strangely grouped.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
The grooves cut in the altars' upper surface are
strongly suggestive of flowing blood, and of slaughtered
victims.<a id="FNanchor_III-24" href="#Footnote_III-24" class="fnanchor">[III-24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I will next mention the miscellaneous relics found
in connection with the ruins, beginning with the court
A. The vault already spoken of, whose entrance is at
<i>o</i>, was undoubtedly intended for burial purposes. Both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
on the floor of the vault and in two small niches at
its sides were found human bones, chiefly in vessels of
red pottery, which were over fifty in number. Lime
was found spread over the floor and mixed with human
remains in the burial vases; also scattered on the floor
were oyster and periwinkle shells, cave stalactites,
sharp-edged and pointed knives of chaya stone, and
three heads, one of them "apparently representing
death, its eyes being nearly shut, and the lower features
distorted; the back of the head symmetrically
perforated by holes; the whole of most exquisite workmanship,
and cut out or cast from a fine stone covered
with green enamel." Another head, very likely one
of the other two found in this vault, its locality,
not, however, being specified, is two inches high, cut
from green and white jade, hollow behind, and pierced
in several places, probably for the introduction of a
cord for its suspension. Its individual character and
artistic workmanship created in Col. Galindo's mind
the impression that it was customary with this people
to wear as ornaments the portraits of deceased
friends.<a id="FNanchor_III-25" href="#Footnote_III-25" class="fnanchor">[III-25]</a></p>

<p>Two thirds of the distance up

immense heads are overturned at
the foot of the same slope; another
is half-way up the southern
steps at w; while numerous fragments
of sculpture are scattered
over the steps and pavement in
every direction. There are no
idols or altars here, but six circular
stones from one foot and a half to three feet in diameter,
found at the foot of the western stairway of the passage

<p class="sidenote">ALTAR OF THE TEMPLE.</p>

<p>In the court B, the only relic beside the statue No.
1 is a remarkable stone monument, generally termed
an altar, at <i>x</i>. This is a solid block of stone six feet
square and four feet high, resting on four globular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
stones, one under each corner. On the sides are carved
sixteen human figures in profile, four on each side.
Each figure is seated cross-legged on a kind of cushion
which is apparently a hieroglyphic, among whose characters
in two or three cases the serpent is observable.
Each wears a breastplate, a head-dress like a turban,&mdash;no
two being, however, exactly alike&mdash;and holds in one
hand some object of unknown significance. The cut
shows the north front of the altar. The two central
figures on this side sit facing each other, with a tablet
of hieroglyphics between them, and may readily be
imagined to represent two kings or chiefs engaged in
a consultation on important matters of state. According
to Mr Stephens' text the other fourteen figures
are divided into two equal parties, each following its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
leader. But the plates represent all those on the east
and west as facing the south, while those on the south
look toward the west. The top is covered with hieroglyphics
in thirty-six squares, as shown the cut on the
preceding page. A peculiarity of this altar is that
its sculpture, unlike that of all the other monuments
of Copan, is in low relief.<a id="FNanchor_III-27" href="#Footnote_III-27" class="fnanchor">[III-27]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS RELICS.</p>

<p>The head shown in the cut is one of the fragments
lying on the ground at the foot of the terraces that
inclose the quadrangle H. On the slopes of these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
terraces, particularly of the eastern slope of the pyramid
<i>e</i>, half-way from top to bottom, are rows of death's
heads in stone. It is suggested that they represent
the skulls of apes rather than of human beings, and
that this animal, abundant in the country, may have
been an object of veneration among the ancient people.
One of the skulls is shown in the cut. The
next cut pictures the head of an alligator carved in
stone, found among the group of idols towards the
south. Another is mentioned by Col. Galindo, as
holding in its open jaws a figure, half human, half
beast. A gigantic toad, standing erect, with human
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
arms and tiger's claws, was another of the relics discovered
by the same explorer, together with round
plain stones pierced by a hole in the centre. Mr Davis
talks of an architrave of black granite finely cut;
and M. Waldeck corrects a statement, in a work by
Balbi, that marble beds are to be found here. The

<p class="sidenote">GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p>Most of the general reflections and speculations on
Copan indulged in by observers and students refer to
other ruined cities in connection with this, and will be
noted in a future chapter. It is to be remarked that
besides pyramids and terraced walls, no traces whatever
of buildings, public or private, remain to guide
us in determining the material or style of architecture
affected by the former people of this region. The absence
of all traces of private dwellings we shall find
universal throughout America, such structures having
evidently been constructed of perishable materials;
but among the more notable ruins of the Pacific
States, Copan stands almost alone in its total lack
of covered edifices. There would seem to be much
reason for the belief that here grand temples of wood
once covered these mighty mounds, which, decaying,
have left no trace of their former grandeur.</p>

<p>Col. Galindo states that the method of forming a
roof here was by means of large inclined stones. If
this be a fact, it must have been ascertained from the
sepulchral vault in the temple court, concerning the
construction of which both he and Stephens are silent.
The top of the gallery leading through the river-wall
would indicate a method of construction by means of
over-lapping blocks, which we shall find employed exclusively
in Yucatan and Chiapas. No article of any
metal whatever has been found; yet as only one burial
deposit has been opened, it is by no means certain that
gold or copper ornaments were not employed. That
iron and steel were not used for cutting implements, is
clearly proved by the fact that hard flinty spots in
the soft stone of the statues are left uncut, in some
instances where they interfere with the details of the
sculpture. Indeed, the chay-stone points found among
the ruins are sufficiently hard to work the soft material,
and although in some cases they seem to have
required the use of metal in their own making, yet
when we consider the well-known skill of even the
most savage tribes in the manufacture of flint weapons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and implements, the difficulty becomes of little weight.
How the immense blocks of stone of which the obelisks
were formed, were transported from the quarry,
several miles distant, without the mechanical aids that
would not be likely to exist prior to the use of iron,
can only be conjectured.</p>

<p>The absence of all implements of a warlike nature,
extending even to the sculptured decorations of idol
and altar, would seem to indicate a population quiet
and peaceable rather than warlike and aggressive; for
though it has been suggested that implements of war
are not found here simply because it is a place sacred
to religion, yet it does not appear that any ancient
people has ever drawn so closely the line between the
gods of war and the other divinities of the pantheon.<a id="FNanchor_III-29" href="#Footnote_III-29" class="fnanchor">[III-29]</a></p>

<p>Of the great artistic merit of the sculpture, particularly
if executed without tools of metal, there can
be no question. Mr Stephens, well qualified by personal
observation to make the comparison, pronounces
some of the specimens "equal to the finest Egyptian
sculpture."<a id="FNanchor_III-30" href="#Footnote_III-30" class="fnanchor">[III-30]</a> Mr Foster believes the flattened forehead
of the human profile on the altar-sides to indicate
a similar cranial conformation in the builders of
the city.<a id="FNanchor_III-31" href="#Footnote_III-31" class="fnanchor">[III-31]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the hieroglyphics all that can be
said is mere conjecture, since no living person even
claims the ability to decipher their meaning. They
have nothing in common with the Aztec picture-writing,
which, consequently, affords no aid in their
study. The characters do, however, appear similar to,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
if not identical with, some of those found at Palenque,
in Yucatan, in the Dresden Codex, and in the Manuscript
Troano. When the disciples of Brasseur de
Bourbourg shall succeed in realizing his expectations
respecting the latter document, by means of the Landa
alphabet, we may expect the mystery to be partially
lifted from Copan. It is hard to resist the belief that
these tablets hold locked up in their mystic characters
the history of the ruined city and its people, or the
hope that the key to their significance may yet be
brought to light; still, in the absence of a contemporary
written language, the hope must be allowed to
rest on a very unsubstantial basis.<a id="FNanchor_III-32" href="#Footnote_III-32" class="fnanchor">[III-32]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE RUINS.</p>

<p>Concerning the age and origin of the Copan monuments,
as distinguished from other American antiquities,
there are few or no facts on which to base an
opinion. The growth of trees on the works, and the
accumulation of vegetable material can in this tropical
climate yield but very unsatisfactory results in this
direction. Copan is, however, generally considered
the oldest of American cities; but I leave for the
present the matter of comparison with more northern
relics. Palacio claims to have found among the people
a tradition of a great lord who came from Yucatan,
built the city of Copan, and after some years returned
and left the newly built town desolate; a tradition
which he inclines to believe, because he says the same
language is understood in both regions, and he had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
heard of similar monuments in Yucatan and Tabasco.
Among the inhabitants of the region in later times,
there is no difference of opinion whatever with respect
to the origin of the ruins or their builders; they are
unanimous in their adherence to the '<span xml:lang="es">quien sabe</span>'
theory.

<p class="sidenote">GUATEMALA.</p>

<p>Above the isthmus of Honduras the continent
widens abruptly, forming between the Rio Motagua
and Laguna de Terminos on the Atlantic, the Rio
Paza and bar of Ayutla on the Pacific, a territory
which stretches some five hundred and fifty miles from
north to south, with a nearly uniform width of two
hundred miles from east to west. Dividing this territory
into two nearly equal portions by a line drawn
near the eighteenth parallel of latitude, the northern
part, between the bay of Chetumal and Laguna de
Terminos, is the peninsula of Yucatan; while that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
portion lying south of the dividing line constitutes the
republic of Guatemala and the English province of
Belize, which latter occupies a strip along the Atlantic
from the gulf of Amatique northward. The Pacific
coast of Guatemala for an average width of seventy
miles is low and unhealthy, with few inhabitants in
modern, as, judging from the absence of material
relics, in ancient times. Then comes a highland tract
which contains the chief towns and most of the white
population of the modern republic; succeeded by the
yet wilder and more mountainous regions of Totonicapan
and Vera Paz, chiefly inhabited by comparatively
savage and unsubdued aboriginal tribes; from which
we descend, still going northward towards Yucatan,
into the little-explored lake region of Peten. At the
time of its conquest by the Spaniards, Guatemala was
the seat of several powerful aboriginal kingdoms, chief
among which were those of the Quichés and Cakchiquels.
They fought long and desperately in defence
of their homes and liberty, and when forced to yield
before Spanish discipline and arms, the few survivors
of the struggle either retired to the inaccessible fastnesses
of the northern highlands, or remained in sullen
forced submission to their conquerors in the homes of
their past greatness&mdash;the aboriginal spirit still unbroken,
and the native superstitious faith yielding
only nominally to Catholic power and persuasion.
Here and in the adjoining state of Chiapas the natives
probably retain to the present day their original character
with fewer modifications than elsewhere in the
Pacific States.</p>

<p>By reason of the peculiar nature of the country, the
grandeur of its mountain scenery, the existence of
large tracts almost unknown to white men, the desperate
struggles of its people for independence, their
wild and haughty disposition, and their strange and
superstitious traditions, Guatemala has always been a
land of mystery, particularly to those who delight in
antiquarian speculations. A residence at Rabinal in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
close contact with the native character in its purest
state first started in the mind of the Abbé Brasseur
de Bourbourg the train of thought that has since developed
into his most startling and complicated theories
respecting American antiquity; and Guatemala
has furnished also many of the documents on which
these theories rest. Few visitors have resisted the
temptation to indulge in speculative fancies or to frame
far-reaching theories respecting ancient ruins or possibly
flourishing cities hidden from the explorer's gaze
in the depths of Guatemalan forests and mountains.</p>

<p>And yet this mysterious land, promising so much,
has yielded to actual exploration only comparatively
trifling results in the form of material relics of antiquity.
The ruins scattered throughout the country
are indeed numerous, but with very few exceptions,
besides being in an advanced state of dilapidation,
they are manifestly the remains of structures destroyed
during the Spanish conquest. Important as proving
the accuracy of the reported power and civilization of
the Quichés and Cakchiquels, and indirectly of the
Aztecs in Anáhuac, where few traces of aboriginal
structures remain for our study, they are still unsatisfactory
to the student who desires to push his researches
back into the more remote American past.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF QUIRIGUA.</p>

<p>Beginning with the province of Chiquimula, bordering
on Honduras and composed for the most part of
the valley of the Motagua and its tributaries, the
first ruin of importance, one of the exceptions noted
above to the general character of Guatemalan antiquities,
is found at Quirigua, fifty miles north-east of
Copan, on the north side of the Motagua, about sixty
miles above its mouth, and ten miles below Encuentros
where the royal road, so called, from Yzabal to
Guatemala crosses the river. The stream is navigable
for small boats to a point opposite the ruins, which are
in a cedar-forest on low moist ground nearly a mile
from the bank.<a id="FNanchor_IV-1" href="#Footnote_IV-1" class="fnanchor">[IV-1]</a> Our only knowledge respecting this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
ancient city comes through Mr Catherwood and Dr
Scherzer. The former, traveling with Mr Stephens,
visited the locality in 1840 in company with the Señores
Payes, proprietors of the estate on which the
ruins stand, and by his description Quirigua first was
made known to the world. Mr Stephens, on hearing
Catherwood's report, entered into negotiations with
the owners of the land for its purchase, with a view to
shipping the monuments to New York, their location
on the banks of a navigable stream being favorable for
the execution of such a purpose; but the interference
of a European official so raised the market value of
ancient real estate that it was found necessary to
abandon the scheme. Dr Karl Scherzer's visit was
in 1854, and his account, published in the Transactions
of the Royal Austrian Academy of Science, and
also reprinted in pamphlet form, is the most extensive
and complete extant.<a id="FNanchor_IV-2" href="#Footnote_IV-2" class="fnanchor">[IV-2]</a> Nothing like a thorough exploration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
has been made even in comparison with those
of Copan and other Central American ruins; but
monuments and fragments thus far brought to light
are found scattered over a space of some three thousand
square feet, on the banks of a small creek which
empties into the Motagua. The site is only very
slightly elevated above the level of the river, and is
consequently often flooded in times of high water;
indeed, during a more than ordinary freshet in 1852,
after Mr Catherwood's visit, several idols were undermined
and overthrown. No aboriginal name is known
for the locality, Quirigua being merely that of a small
village at the foot of Mount Mico, not far distant.
There being no plan extant by which to locate the different
objects to be mentioned in this old centre of
civilization, I will give the slight descriptions obtainable,
with very slight reference to their arrangement,
beginning with the pyramid which seems to occupy a
somewhat central position round which the other relics
are grouped. Catherwood's description of this structure
is limited to the statement that it is "like those
at Copan, with the steps in some places perfect," and
twenty-five feet high. Scherzer's account only adds
that it is constructed of neatly cut sandstone in regular
oblong blocks, and is very much ruined, hardly
more, in fact, than a confused mass of fragments,
among which were found some pieces of fine white
marble. But under this structure there is, it seems, a
foundation, an artificial hill, or mound, of rough stones
without mortar. The base is an irregular square, the
dimensions of which are not stated, with a spur extending
toward the south. The steps which lead up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the sides to the super-imposed structure are only eight
or nine inches high and six or seven inches in width,
remaining intact only at a few points. In the upper
part of the mound are two or three terraces, on the
first of which several recesses, or niches, of no great
extent are noticed; they are lined with small rough
stones, plastered, and in a good state of preservation,
details which indicated to the observer that these
niches may be of more modern origin than the rest of
the ruin. There are no traces of openings to show
that the hill contained underground apartments;
neither are there any sculptures on the hewn stones of
the pyramid itself, nor any idols or carved fragments
found on the surface of the mound.</p>

<p>Very near the foot of the mound Mr Catherwood
found a moss-covered colossal head six feet in diameter,
and a large altar, both relics being within an enclosure.<a id="FNanchor_IV-3" href="#Footnote_IV-3" class="fnanchor">[IV-3]</a>
Scherzer also describes several monuments near the
pyramid, some of which may be identical with the
ones mentioned by Catherwood, although he says
nothing of an enclosure. The first is a stone of a long
oval form like a human head, six feet high and thirty-five
feet in circumference, the surface being covered
with carved figures in demi-relief, which for some reason
have been better preserved and present clearer outlines
than other carvings at Quirigua. One of the most
clearly defined of these sculptures represents a sitting
female, whose legs and hands are wanting, but whose
arms hang down to the ground. A prominent feature is
her head-dress, sixteen inches high, the upper part of
which is an idol's head crowned with a diadem. The
forehead is described as narrow, depressed above and
projecting below. The features are indistinct, but the
form of the head is of what Scherzer terms the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
type. On the south side of this block, or altar,
is the rude figure of a turtle five feet high. The top
is covered with ornamental figures representing plants
and fruits, all the varieties there delineated being such
as still flourish in this region. The sides bear also
faint indications of hieroglyphics. Dr Scherzer believes
that the stone used in the construction of this
altar must have been found on the spot, since by reason
of its great size it could not have been brought
from a distance with the aid of any mechanical appliances
known to native art.<a id="FNanchor_IV-4" href="#Footnote_IV-4" class="fnanchor">[IV-4]</a> The second of these
monuments is like a mill-stone, four feet in diameter
and two feet thick, cut from harder material than the
other objects. A tiger's head nearly covers one side
of the disk, and the rest of the surface, including the
rim, is covered with hieroglyphics, several of these
mysterious signs appearing on the animal's forehead.
The third of the relics found near the pyramid is a
fragment eighteen feet long and five feet wide, the
upper portion having disappeared. The human face
appears at different points among its hieroglyphics and
ornaments.</p>

<p class="sidenote">STATUES OF QUIRIGUA.</p>

<p>Three or four hundred yards northward from the
mound, and at the foot of a 'pyramidal wall,' concerning
which we have no information beyond the
mention of its existence, is a group of sculptured idols,
pillars, or obelisks, standing in the forest like those in
the sacred enclosure at Copan. Indeed, they bear a
strong resemblance to the latter, except in their greater
height and less elaborate sculpture, which is also in
lower relief. Twelve of them are definitely mentioned,
the smallest of which is nine feet high, and the largest
twenty-six feet above ground, increasing in size toward
the top, leaning twelve feet out of the perpendicular,
and requiring, of course, some six or eight feet below
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the surface to sustain its weight in such a position.<a id="FNanchor_IV-5" href="#Footnote_IV-5" class="fnanchor">[IV-5]</a>
They are from two to three feet thick and four to six
feet wide. In most instances a human face, male or
female, appears on the front or back or both; while
the sides are covered for the most part with hieroglyphics,
which are also seen on various parts of the
dress and ornaments. One statue is, however, mentioned,
which, although crowded with ornaments, has
no character, apparently, of hieroglyphic nature. One
of the idols, twenty-three feet high, stands on a stone
foundation projecting some fifteen feet; and another,
circular instead of rectangular in form, rests on a
small mound, within a wall of stones enclosing a small
circular area.<a id="FNanchor_IV-6" href="#Footnote_IV-6" class="fnanchor">[IV-6]</a> In one the human figure has a head-dress
of which an animal's head forms a prominent
part, while in yet another the head is half human and
half animal. In both cases the aim of the artist
would seem to have been to inspire terror, as in the
case of some Nicaraguan idols already noticed. Mr
Catherwood made sketches of two of the obelisks,
including the leaning one, the largest of all; but as
he could not clean them of moss in the limited time
at his disposal, he makes no attempt to give the details
of sculpture, and a reproduction of the plates is
therefore not deemed necessary. The two monuments
sketched by him could not be found at all by Dr
Scherzer. The Quirigua idols have not, like those at
Copan, altars in front of them, but several altars, or
apparently such, were found buried in moss and earth,
and not carefully examined by either of the explorers.
They are usually of round or oval form, with hieroglyphically
inscribed sides; and one of them, within
the circular wall with steps, already mentioned as enclosing
one of the statues,<a id="FNanchor_IV-7" href="#Footnote_IV-7" class="fnanchor">[IV-7]</a> is described as supported
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
by two colossal heads. Many fragments were noticed
which are not described; and here as elsewhere monuments
superior to any seen were reported to exist
by enthusiastic guides and natives; in which latter
class of antiquities are eleven square columns higher
than those mentioned, and also a female holding a
child, and an alligator's head in stone.<a id="FNanchor_IV-8" href="#Footnote_IV-8" class="fnanchor">[IV-8]</a> The material
of all the stone work of Quirigua is a soft coarse-grained
sandstone, not differing materially, so far as I can
judge, from that employed at Copan. It is the prevalent
formation at both localities, and may be quarried
readily at almost any point in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Absolutely no traditions have been preserved respecting
Quirigua in the days when its monuments
were yet intact, when a large town, which has left no
traces, must have stood in the immediate vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_IV-9" href="#Footnote_IV-9" class="fnanchor">[IV-9]</a>
The idols scattered over the surface of the ground, instead
of being located on the pyramids, may indicate
here as at Copan that the elevations served as seats
for spectators during the religious ceremonies, rather
than as temples or altars on which sacrifice was made.
Both observers agree on the general similarity between
the monuments of Quirigua and Copan,<a id="FNanchor_IV-10" href="#Footnote_IV-10" class="fnanchor">[IV-10]</a> and the
hieroglyphics are pronounced identical. Indeed, it
seems altogether probable that they owe their existence
to the same era and the same people. Mr
Stephens notes, besides the greater size and lower
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
relief of the Quirigua monuments, that they are "less
rich in design, and more faded and worn, probably being
of a much older date." Dr Scherzer speaks of the
greater plumpness of the sculptured figures, and has
no faith in their great antiquity, believing that the
low-relief carvings on so soft a material, would, when
exposed in an atmosphere so moist, have been utterly
obliterated in a thousand years.<a id="FNanchor_IV-11" href="#Footnote_IV-11" class="fnanchor">[IV-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHAPULCO AND CHINAMITA.</p>

<p>At Chapulco, a few leagues below Quirigua, on the
opposite side of the Motagua, one traveler speaks of
a quadrilateral pyramid with terraced sides, up which
steps lead to the summit platform, where débris of
hewn stone are enveloped in a dense vegetation. Also
at Chinamita, some sixteen miles above Quirigua on
the same side of the river, the same authority reports
a large area covered with aboriginal relics, in the form
of ruined stone structures, vases and idols of burned
clay, and monoliths buried for the most part in the
earth. Of course, with this meagre information, it is
impossible to form any definite idea of what these
ruins really are, and whether they should be classed
with Quirigua and Copan, or with a more modern class
of Guatemalan antiquities. The same remark will
apply also to many of the localities of this state, of
whose relics we have no description in detail.<a id="FNanchor_IV-12" href="#Footnote_IV-12" class="fnanchor">[IV-12]</a></p>

<p>At Micla, or Mimilla, some three leagues north of
lake Guijar, or Uxaca, which is on the boundary between
Guatemala and Salvador, traces of a sacred
town with its cues and temples are spoken of as visible
in 1576. They are represented as of the class
erected by the Pipiles who occupied the region at the
time of the conquest.<a id="FNanchor_IV-13" href="#Footnote_IV-13" class="fnanchor">[IV-13]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CINACA-MECALLO.</p>

<p>Still farther south-west towards the coast, a few
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
miles south, of Comapa, are the ruins of Cinaca-Mecallo,
a name said to mean 'knotted rope.' The Rio
Paza here forms the boundary line between the two
states, and from its northern bank rises abruptly a
mountain chain. On the summit, at a point commanding
a broad view over a large portion of Salvador,
is a plain of considerable extent, watered by several
small mountain streams, which unite and fall over a
precipice on the way to the river below. On the
highest portion of this summit plain interesting works
of the former inhabitants have been discovered by D.
José Antonio Urrutia, padre in charge of the church
at Jutiapa.<a id="FNanchor_IV-14" href="#Footnote_IV-14" class="fnanchor">[IV-14]</a> The remains of Cinaca-Mecallo cover an
oval area formerly surrounded by a wall, of which
fragments yet remain sufficient to mark the line originally
followed. Within this space are vestiges of
streets, ruined buildings, and subterranean passages.
Padre Urrutia makes special mention of four monuments.
The first is what he terms a temple of the
sun, an excavation in the solid rock opening towards
the rising sun, and having at its entrance an archway
known to the natives as 'stone of the sun,' formed
of stone slabs closely joined. On these slabs are
carved in low relief figures of the sun and moon, to
which are added hieroglyphics painted on the stone
with a very durable kind of red varnish. There are
also some sculptured hieroglyphic signs on the interior
walls of this artificial cavern. The second monument
is a great slab covered with carved inscriptions, among
which were noted a tree and a skull, emblematic,
according to the padre's views, of life and death.
Next is mentioned the representation of a tiger or
other wild animal cut on the side of a large rock.
This monument is, it appears, some distance from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
other ruins, and is conjectured by Urrutia to be a commemoration
of some historical event, from the fact
that the natives still celebrate past deeds of valor by
dances, or scenic representations, in which they dress
in imitation of different animals. Mr Squier suggests
farther that the event thus commemorated may have
been a conflict between the Pipiles and the Cakchiquels,
in which the latter were driven permanently
from this district. The fourth and last of these monuments
is one of the subterranean passages which the
explorer penetrated until he reached a kind of chamber
where were some sculptured blocks. This underground
apartment is celebrated among the natives as
having been in modern times the resort of a famous
robber chief, who was at last brought to bay and captured
here in his stronghold. The material employed
in all the Cinaca-Mecallo structures is a slate-like
stone in thin blocks, joined by a cement which resembles
in color and consistence molten lead. Some of
the carved blocks were sent by the discoverer as specimens
to the city of Guatemala. Outside the walls
are tumuli of earth and small stones, with no sculptured
fragments. These are supposed to be burial
mounds, and to vary in size according to the rank and
importance of the personages whose resting-places
they mark.</p>

<p>Proceeding now north-eastward to the region lying
within a circle of fifty miles about the city of Guatemala
as a centre, we have a reported cave on the
hacienda of Peñol, perhaps twenty-five miles east of
Guatemala, which is said to have been explored for at
least a distance of one mile, and is believed by the
credulous natives to extend eleven leagues through
the mountain to the Rio de los Esclavos. In this cavern,
or at least on the same hacienda, if we may credit
Fuentes, human bones of extraordinary size were
found, including shin-bones about five feet in length.
These human relics crumbled on being touched, but
fragments were carefully gathered up and sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Guatemala, since which time nothing is known of
them.<a id="FNanchor_IV-15" href="#Footnote_IV-15" class="fnanchor">[IV-15]</a> On the hacienda of Carrizal, some twenty
miles north of Guatemala, we hear of cyclopean débris,
or masses of great unhewn stones heaped one on
another without cement, and forming gigantic walls,
which cover a considerable extent of territory on the
lofty heights that guard the approaches to the Motagua
Valley.<a id="FNanchor_IV-16" href="#Footnote_IV-16" class="fnanchor">[IV-16]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">COPPER MEDALS AND FORTIFICATIONS.</p>

<p>The immediate vicinity of Guatemala seems not to
have yielded any antiquarian relics of importance.
M. Valois reports the plain to be studded with mounds
which the natives regard as the tombs of their ancestors,
which others have searched for treasure, but
which he believes to be ant-hills.<a id="FNanchor_IV-17" href="#Footnote_IV-17" class="fnanchor">[IV-17]</a> Ordoñez claims to
have found here two pure copper medals, fac-similes
one of the other, two inches in diameter and three
lines thick, a little heavier than a Mexican peso fuerte,
engraved on both sides, as shown in the cut, which I
give herewith notwithstanding the fact that this
must be regarded as a relic of doubtful authenticity.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
M. Dupaix noticed an indication of the use of the
compass in the centre of one of the sides, the figures
on the same side representing a kneeling, bearded,
turbaned man, between two fierce heads, perhaps of
crocodiles, which appear to defend the entrance to a
mountainous and wooded country. The reverse presents
a serpent coiled round a fruit-tree, and an eagle&mdash;quite
as much like a dove or crow or other bird&mdash;on
a hill. There are, besides, some ornamental figures
on the rim, said to resemble those of Palenque, and,
indeed, Ordoñez refers the origin of these medals to
the founders of that city. He kept one of them and
sent the other to the king of Spain in 1794.<a id="FNanchor_IV-18" href="#Footnote_IV-18" class="fnanchor">[IV-18]</a></p>

<p>About 1860, a stone idol forty inches high was dug
up in a yard of the city, where it had been buried
fifty years before, having been brought by the natives
from a point one hundred and fifty miles distant. Its
discovery was mentioned at a meeting of the American
Ethnological Society in 1861, by Mr Hicks. The
same gentleman also spoke of the reported discovery
of a great city in ruins in the province of Esquimatha,
buried in a dense forest about fifty-six miles from the
city.<a id="FNanchor_IV-19" href="#Footnote_IV-19" class="fnanchor">[IV-19]</a></p>

<p>A few leagues west of the city are the ruins of
Mixco, a fortified town of the natives down to the
time of the conquest, mentioned by several authorities
but described by none. Fuentes, however, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
quoted by Juarros, speaks of a cavern on a small
ridge by the side of the ruins. The entrance was a
Doric portico of clay about three feet wide and high.
A flight of thirty-six stone steps leads down to a room
one hundred and twenty feet square, followed by
another flight still leading downward. This latter
stairway no one has had the courage to fully explore,
on account of the tremulous and insecure condition of
the ground. Eighteen steps down this second flight,
however, is an arched entrance on the right side, to a
passage which, after a descent of six steps, has been
explored for a distance of one hundred and forty feet.
Furthermore, the author tells us there are some extravagant
(!) accounts not worthy of implicit belief,
and consequently not repeated by him. Hassel states
that gigantic bones have been found here, and that the
cave is natural, without any artificial improvements
whatever.<a id="FNanchor_IV-20" href="#Footnote_IV-20" class="fnanchor">[IV-20]</a></p>

<p>In this same valley, where the Pancacoya River
enters the Xilotepec, Juarros speaks of "a range of
columns curiously wrought, with capitals, mouldings,
etc.; and a little farther on there are several round cisterns
formed in the rock." The cisterns are about four
feet in diameter and three feet deep, and may have
served originally, as the author remarks, for washing
auriferous earths in the search for gold.<a id="FNanchor_IV-21" href="#Footnote_IV-21" class="fnanchor">[IV-21]</a> The Santa
María River, near its junction with the Motagua, is
said to flow for a long distance underground, and at the
entrance to its subterranean channel are reported some
carvings, the work of human hands, but from superstitious
fears the interior of this bewitched cave has
never been explored.<a id="FNanchor_IV-22" href="#Footnote_IV-22" class="fnanchor">[IV-22]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PETAPA, ROSARIO, AND PATINAMIT.</p>

<p>Petapa, twelve or fifteen miles southward from Guatemala
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
on Lake Amatitlan is another of the localities
where the old authors report the discovery of mammoth
human bones, including a tooth as large as a
man's two fists. Such reports, where they have any
other than an imaginary foundation, may probably
result from the finding of animal bones, by which the
good padres were deceived into the belief that they
had come upon traces of the ancient giants reported
in all the native traditions, which did not seem to
them unworthy of belief, since they were told elsewhere
that "there were giants on the earth in those
days."<a id="FNanchor_IV-23" href="#Footnote_IV-23" class="fnanchor">[IV-23]</a></p>

<p>At Rosario, eight or ten miles south of the same
lake, we have a bare mention of a beautiful aqueduct
in ruins.<a id="FNanchor_IV-24" href="#Footnote_IV-24" class="fnanchor">[IV-24]</a> Twenty-five or thirty miles west of the
lake, at the western foot of the volcano of Fuego, Don
José María Asmitia, a Guatemalan official of antiquarian
tendencies, reports the discovery on his estate of
a well-preserved aqueduct, constructed of hewn stone
and mortar, together with nine stone idols each six
feet in height. He proposed to make, at an early
date, more thorough explorations in that vicinity.
Like other explorers he had his theory, although he
had not personally seen even the relics on his own
estate; deriving the American culture from a Carthaginian
source.<a id="FNanchor_IV-25" href="#Footnote_IV-25" class="fnanchor">[IV-25]</a> Farther south on the Pacific lowlands,
at a point called Calche, between Escuintla and
Suchiltepeques, the Abbé Brasseur speaks of a pyramid
cut from solid stone, which had been seen by
many Guatemalans.<a id="FNanchor_IV-26" href="#Footnote_IV-26" class="fnanchor">[IV-26]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF PATINAMIT.</p>

<p>Passing now north-westward to the region lying
about Lake Atitlan, and noting that the town of Sololá
on the northern lake-shore is said to be built on
the ruins of the aboriginal Tecpan Atitlan,<a id="FNanchor_IV-27" href="#Footnote_IV-27" class="fnanchor">[IV-27]</a> we come
to the ruins of the ancient Patinamit, 'the city', the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Cakchiquel capital. It is near<a id="FNanchor_IV-28" href="#Footnote_IV-28" class="fnanchor">[IV-28]</a> the modern town of
Tecpan Guatemala, fifteen miles south-east of the lake,
and forty miles north-west of Guatemala. The aboriginal
town, to which Brasseur de Bourbourg would
assign a very ancient, pre-Toltec origin, was inhabited
down to the time when the conquistadores came, and
was by them destroyed. With the state of the city
as found and described by them, I have, of course,
nothing to do in this volume, having simply to record
the condition of the ruins as observed at subsequent
periods, although in the descriptions extant the two
phases of the city's condition are considerably confounded.
The remains are found on a level plateau
having an area of several square miles, and surrounded
by a ravine from one hundred to four hundred feet in
depth, with precipitous sides. The plateau is accessible
at one point only by a path artificially cut in the
side of the barranca, twenty to thirty feet deep, and
only wide enough to permit the passage of a single
horseman. At the time of Mr Stephens' visit nothing
was visible but confused irregular masses, or mounds,
of fallen walls, among which, however, could still be
made out the foundations of two buildings, one of
them fifty by one hundred feet. Two sculptured
figures were pointed out by the natives, lying on the
ground, on one of which the nose and eyes of some
animal were discernible. Fuentes, who wrote in the
century following the conquest, observed, during his
examination of the city, more definite traces of its
former grandeur. Two gates of chay-stone afforded
entrance to the narrow passage which led up to the
plateau; a coating, or layer, of clay covered the soil to
a depth of two feet; and a trench six or eight feet
deep, faced with stone and having also a breastwork
of masonry three feet high, running north and south
across the table, divided the city's site into two portions,
inhabited, as is suggested, respectively by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
plebeian and aristocratic classes of its original citizens.
The street-lines, crossing each other at right angles,
were traceable, indicating that the city was regularly
laid out in blocks. One of the structures whose
foundations were then to be seen was a hundred yards
square, besides which there remained the ruins of
what is described as a palace, and of several houses.
West of the city, on a mound six feet high, was "a
pedestal formed of a shining substance, resembling
glass." Brasseur also mentions 'vastes souterrains,'
which, as usual, he does not deign farther to describe.
The modern town is built to a considerable extent, and
its streets are paved, with fragments of the hewn stone
from Patinamit, which have been carried piece by
piece on the backs of natives up and down the sides
of the barranca. The aborigines still look with feelings
of superstitious respect on this memorial of their
ancestral glory, and at times their faithful ears detect
the chimes of bells proceeding from beneath the hill.
A famous black stone was, in the days of aboriginal
independence, an object of great veneration in the
Cakchiquel religious rites connected with the fate of
prisoners, its shrine being in the depths of a dark
ravine near at hand. In Fuentes' time it had been
consecrated by the Catholic bishop and placed on the
altar of the church. He describes it as of singular
beauty and about eighteen inches square. Stephens
found it still on the altar, the object of the people's
jealous veneration; and when his Spanish companion
had, with sacrilegious hand, to the infinite terror of
the parish priest, ripped open the cotton sack in which
the relic was enveloped, there appeared only a plain
piece of ordinary slate measuring ten by fourteen
inches. Brasseur de Bourbourg, however, believes
that the former visitors were both in error, and that
the original black stone was never permitted to fall
into the hands of the Spanish unbelievers.<a id="FNanchor_IV-29" href="#Footnote_IV-29" class="fnanchor">[IV-29]</a> At Patzun,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a native pueblo near Tecpan Guatemala, two
mounds were noticed, but not opened.<a id="FNanchor_IV-30" href="#Footnote_IV-30" class="fnanchor">[IV-30]</a></p>

<p>Quezaltenango, the aboriginal Xelahuh, is some
twenty-five or thirty miles westward from Lake Atitlan.
In the days of Quiché power this city was one
of the largest and most powerful in the land. I find
no evidence that any remains of the town itself are
to be seen, though Wappäus speaks of such remains,
even classing them with the most ancient type of
Guatemalan antiquities. Two fortresses in this vicinity,
however, Olintepec and Parrazquin, supposed to
have guarded the approaches to Xelahuh, are said to
have left some traces of their former strength.<a id="FNanchor_IV-31" href="#Footnote_IV-31" class="fnanchor">[IV-31]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF UTATLAN.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i126"></a>
<img src="images/i126.jpg" width="441" height="201" alt="" />
<p class="caption">El Sacrificatorio at Utatlan.</p>
</div>

<p>Thirty miles farther back in the mountains north-eastward
from Quezaltenango, toward the confines of
Vera Paz, was Utatlan, 'road of the waters,' in the
native language Gumarcaah, the Quiché capital and
stronghold, at the modern town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.
This city was the richest and most magnificent
found by the Spaniards south of Mexico, and at the
time of its destruction by them was, unlike most aboriginal
American towns, in its highest state of prosperity.
Slight as are the ruins that remain, they are sufficient
to show that the Spanish accounts of the city's original
splendor were not greatly exaggerated; this, with
the contrasts which these ruins present in the absence
of statues, sculpture, and hieroglyphics, and in other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
respects, when compared with those of Quirigua and
Copan, constitutes their chief importance in archæological
investigations. Like Patinamit, Utatlan stood
on a plateau, or mesa, bounded by a deep ravine on
every side, a part of which ravine is believed to be
of artificial construction. The barranca can only be
crossed and the site of the city reached at one point,
from the south-east. Guarding this single approach,
at the distance of about half a mile from the village
of Santa Cruz, are the ruins of a long line of structures
of carefully laid hewn stone, evidently intended
as fortifications and connected one with another by a
ditch. Within this line and more immediately guarding
the passage, is an immense fortress, El Resguardo,
one hundred and twenty feet high, in the form of a
square-based pyramidal structure, with three ranges
of terraces, and steps leading up from one to another.
A stone wall, plastered with a hard cement, incloses
the area of the summit platform, in the centre of
which rises a tower furnished with steps, which were
also originally covered with cement. Crossing the
barranca from the fort Resguardo, we find the table
which was the site of the ancient city covered throughout
its whole extent with shapeless masses of ruins,
among which the foundations of a few structures only
can be definitely made out. The chief edifice, known
as the grand castle, or palace, of the Quiché kings, and
said to have been in round numbers eleven hundred
by twenty-two hundred feet, occupied a central position.
Its upper portions have been carried away and
used in the construction of the modern town, but in
1810, if we may trust the cura of the parish, the
building was still entire. The floors remain, covered
with a hard and durable cement, and also fragments
of the partition walls sufficient to indicate something
of the original ground plan. A plaster of finer
quality than that employed on the floors and pyramids,
covers the inner walls, with evident traces of
having been colored or painted. The ruins of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
fountain appear in an open court-yard, also paved with
cement. Another structure, El Sacrificatorio, still
visible, is a pyramid of stone sixty-six feet square at
the base and, in its present state, thirty-three feet
high, the plan and elevation of which are shown in
the cuts. Each side except the western is ascended
by a flight of nineteen steps, each step eight inches
wide and seventeen inches high. The western side is
covered with stucco, laid on, as is ascertained by careful
examination, in several successive coatings, each
painted with ornamental figures, among which the
body of a leopard only could be distinguished. The
pyramid is supported by a buttress in each of the four
corners, diminishing in size toward the top. The summit
is in ruins, but our knowledge of the Quiché religious
ceremonies, as set forth in the preceding volume
of this work, leaves little doubt that this was a place of
sacrifice and supported an altar. No sculpture has
been found in connection with the ruins of Utatlan.
Its absence is certainly remarkable; but it is to be
noted that the natives of this region have always been
of a haughty, unsubdued spirit, ardently attached to
the memory of their ancestors; and the destruction or
concealment of their idols with a view to keep them
from the sacrilegious touch and gaze of the white
man, would be in accordance with their well-known
character. They have the greatest respect for the
holy pyramid on the plateau, and at one time when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the reported discovery of a golden image prompted the
destruction of the palace in search of treasure, the
popular indignation on the part of the natives presaged
a serious revolt and compelled the abandonment
of the scheme, not, however, until the walls had been
razed. Flint arrow-heads are mentioned as of frequent
occurrence among the débris of fortifications
outside the barranca, and a Spanish explorer in 1834
found a sitting figure twelve inches high, and two
heads of terra cotta exceedingly hard, smooth, and of
good workmanship. One of the heads was solid, the
other and the idol were hollow. The annexed cut
shows the sitting figure. Under one of the buildings
is an opening to what the natives represented as a subterranean
passage leading by an hour's journey to
Mexico, but which only revealed to Mr Stephens, who
entered it, the presence of a roof formed by overlapping
stones. This form of arch will be described in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
detail when I come to speak of more northern ruins,
where it is of frequent occurrence. That a long time
must have passed between the erection of Copan and
Utatlan, the civilization of the builders meantime undergoing
great modifications, involving probably the
introduction of new elements from foreign sources, is
a theory supported by a careful study of the two
classes of remains. For an account of Utatlan and
other Guatemalan cities as they were in the time of
their aboriginal glory, I refer the reader to Volume II.

</div>

<p>North-westward from Utatlan, thirty or forty miles
distant, in the province of Totonicapan, is the town of
Huehuetenango, and near it, located like Utatlan on
a ravine-guarded plain, are the ruins of Zakuléu, the
ancient capital of the Mams, now known popularly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
as Las Cuevas. These remains are in an advanced
state of dilapidation, hardly more than confused heaps
of rubbish scattered over the plain, and overgrown
with grass and shrubs. Two pyramidal structures of
rough stones in mortar, formerly covered with stucco,
can, however, still be made out. One of them is one
hundred and two feet square and twenty-eight high,
with steps, each four feet in height and seven feet
wide. The top is small and square, and a long rough
slab found at the base may, as Mr Stephens suggests,
have been the altar thrown down from its former position
on the platform. There are also several small
mounds, supposed to be sepulchral, one of which was
opened, and disclosed within an enclosure of rough
stones and lime some fragments of bone and two
vases of fine workmanship, whose material is not
stated but is probably earthen ware. One of them
is shown in the cut, and bears a striking resemblance
to some of the burial vases of Nicaragua.<a id="FNanchor_IV-34" href="#Footnote_IV-34" class="fnanchor">[IV-34]</a> Another
burial vault, not long enough, however, to contain a
human being at full length, at the foot of one of the
pyramids, was faced with cut stone, and from it the
proprietor of the estate took a quantity of bones and
the terra-cotta tripod shown in the cut. It has a polished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
surface and is one foot in diameter. At a point
on the river where the banks had been washed away
at the time of high water, some animal skeletons of
extraordinary size were brought to light. Mr Stephens
saw in the bank the imprint of one of these measuring
twenty-five or thirty feet in length, and others
were said to be yet larger.<a id="FNanchor_IV-35" href="#Footnote_IV-35" class="fnanchor">[IV-35]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS IN RABINAL VALLEY.</p>

<p>Extending eastward from the region of Huehuetenango
to that of Salama in the province of Vera Paz,
a distance of nearly one hundred miles, there seems to
be a line of ruins, occurring at frequent intervals, particularly
in the valley of the Rabinal and about the
town of that name. A map of Guatemala now before
me locates seventeen of these ruins, and M. Brasseur
de Bourbourg incidentally mentions many of them by
name, none of them, however, being anywhere described
in detail. It is much to be regretted that the
last-named author, during a residence at Rabinal, did
not more fully improve his opportunities for the examination
of these remains, or, at least, that he has never
made known to the world the result of his investigations.
All the ruins along this line would seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
belong to the class of those occupied by the natives,
chiefly Cakchiquels, at the time of the conquest, most
of them being the remains of fortresses or fortified
towns, built on strong natural positions at the river-mouths,
guarding the entrance to fertile valleys.</p>

<p>Opposite the mouth of the River Rabinal, where
the Pacalah empties into the Chixoy, or Usumacinta,
are the ruins of Cawinal, visited by the Abbé Brasseur
in 1856, and by him pronounced the finest in
Vera Paz. They are situated on both sides of the
stream in a fine mountain-girt valley, the approach to
which was guarded by a long line of fortifications,
pyramidal mounds, and watch-towers, whose remains
may yet be seen. Among these structures is a pyramid
of two terraces, forty feet high, ascended by a
stairway of three flights, with the ruined walls of
three small buildings on its summit. Near many of
the old towns, especially in the Rabinal district,
tumuli&mdash;<i>cakhay</i>, 'red houses'&mdash;very like in form and
material to those of the Mississippi Valley are said to
be numerous.<a id="FNanchor_IV-36" href="#Footnote_IV-36" class="fnanchor">[IV-36]</a></p>

<p>Besides the ruins actually seen and vaguely described,
there are reports of others. The province is
large and comparatively unexplored, its people wild
and independent, and both have ever been to travelers
the object of much mysterious conjecture, increasing
in intensity as the northern region of Peten is approached.
In 1850 Mr Squier wrote, "there has
lately been discovered, in the province of Vera Paz,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
150 miles north-east of Guatemala, buried in a dense
forest, and far from any settlements, a ruined city, surpassing
Copan or Palenque in extent and magnificence,
and displaying a degree of art to which none of the
structures of Yucatan can lay claim."<a id="FNanchor_IV-37" href="#Footnote_IV-37" class="fnanchor">[IV-37]</a> The cura of
Santa Cruz had once lived in Coban, some forty miles
north of Rabinal, and four leagues from there he
claimed to have seen an ancient city as large as Utatlan,
its palace being still entire at the time of his
visit.<a id="FNanchor_IV-38" href="#Footnote_IV-38" class="fnanchor">[IV-38]</a> One Leon de Pontelli claims to have traveled
extensively in these parts in 1859, and to have discovered
many ancient and remarkable ruins of great
cities, at points impossible to locate, somewhere about
the confines of Vera Paz and Peten. Pontelli is not
regarded as a trustworthy explorer, and no positive
information whatever is to be obtained from his
account.<a id="FNanchor_IV-39" href="#Footnote_IV-39" class="fnanchor">[IV-39]</a></p>

<p>Not only are cities in ruins reported to exist, but
also somewhere in this region, four days' journey from
Utatlan towards Mexico, an inhabited city in all its
aboriginal magnificence is said to be visible, far out on
the plain, from the summit of a lofty sierra. The cura
of Santa Cruz before mentioned had gazed upon its
glittering turrets and had heard from the natives traditions
of its splendor, and the failure of all attempts
on the part of white men to approach its walls for the
purpose of a closer examination. One other man had
the courage to climb the sierra, but on the day chosen
for the ascent the city was rendered invisible by mists.
The intelligence and general reliability of the good
cura inclined Mr Stephens to put some faith in the
accuracy of his report; others, however, not without
reason, are sceptical about the matter.<a id="FNanchor_IV-40" href="#Footnote_IV-40" class="fnanchor">[IV-40]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PROVINCE OF PETEN.</p>

<p>Leaving the lofty highlands of Vera Paz, we descend
northward to the province of Peten, a comparatively
low region whose central portion is occupied by
several large lakes. It is in this lake region chiefly
that antiquities have been brought to light by the few
travelers who have penetrated this far-off country,
less known, perhaps, than any other portion of Central
America. The Spaniards found the Itzas, a Maya
branch from Yucatan, established here, their capital,
Tayasal, a city of no small pretensions to magnificence,
being on an island now known as Remedios, in
Lake Itza, or Peten, where the town of Flores is now
situated. Flores is built indeed on the ruins of the
aboriginal city, which, however, has left no relics of
sculpture or architecture to substantiate the Spanish
accounts of its magnificent structures, which included
twenty-one <span xml:lang="es">adoratorios</span>. Rude earthen figures and
vessels are, however, occasionally exhumed; and M.
Morelet heard of one vase of some hard transparent
material, very beautifully formed and ornamented.
This relic had passed into the hands of a Tabascan
merchant. Sr Fajardo, commissioner to establish the
boundary between Mexico and Guatemala, furnished
to Sr I. R. Gondra drawings of some <i>nacas</i>, or small
idols, found in the Peten graves. Sr Gondra pronounces
them similar to those of Yucatan as represented
by Stephens.<a id="FNanchor_IV-41" href="#Footnote_IV-41" class="fnanchor">[IV-41]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>On the north side of the lake is the small town of
San José, and a spot two days' journey south-eastward
from here&mdash;although this would, according to the
maps, carry us back across the lake&mdash;is given as the
locality of three large edifices buried in the forest,
called by the natives Casas Grandes. All we know
of them rests on the report of an Indian chief, who
was induced by M. Morelet to depart from the characteristic
reserve and secrecy of his race respecting the
works of the antiguos; consequently the statement
that the buildings are covered with sculptures in high
relief, closely analogous to those of Palenque, must
be accepted with some allowance.<a id="FNanchor_IV-42" href="#Footnote_IV-42" class="fnanchor">[IV-42]</a></p>

<p>Two days eastward of Lake Peten, on the route to
Belize, is the lake of Yaxhaa, Yachá, or Yasja, one
of the isles in which is said to be covered with débris
of former structures. Col. Galindo, who visited the
locality in 1831, is the only one who has written of
the ruins from personal observation, and he only describes
one structure, which he terms the most remarkable
of all. This is a tower of five stories, each nine
feet high, each of less length and breadth than the one
below it, and the lower one sixty-six feet square. No
doors or windows appear in the four lower stories,
although Galindo, from the hollow sound emitted
under blows, supposed them not to be solid. A stairway
seven feet wide, of steps each four inches high,
leads up to the base of the fifth story on the west, at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
which point, as on the opposite eastern side, is an entrance
only high enough for a man to crawl through
on hands and knees. This upper story is divided into
three apartments communicating with each other by
means of low doors, and now roofless, but presenting
signs of having been originally covered with the
overlapping arch. The whole structure is of hewn
stone laid in mortar, and no traces of wood remain.
It is evident that this building is entirely different
from any other monuments which we have thus far
met in our progress northward, and further north we
shall meet few if any of a similar nature. So far as
the data are sufficient to justify conclusions, this may
safely be classed with the older remains at Copan and
Quirigua, rather than with the more modern Quiché-Cakchiquel
structures. There are no means of determining
with any degree of accuracy whether these
buildings of Yaxhaa were the work of the Itzas or of
a more ancient branch of the Maya people.<a id="FNanchor_IV-43" href="#Footnote_IV-43" class="fnanchor">[IV-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF TIKAL.</p>

<p>About forty miles north-east from the eastern end
of Lake Peten, in the foothills of the mountains, but
in a locality inaccessible from the direction of the
lake except in the dry season, from January to June,
are the ruins of Tikal, a name signifying in the Maya
language 'destroyed palaces.' So dry is the locality,
however, during this dry season, that water must be
carried in casks, or thirst quenched with the juice of a
peculiar variety of reed that grows in the region. A
more thorough search might reveal natural wells,
which supplied water to the ancient inhabitants, as
was the case further north in Yucatan. The ruined
structures of Tikal are reported to extend over a
space of at least a league, and they were discovered,
although their existence had been previously reported
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
by the natives, in 1848, by Governor Ambrosio Tut
and Colonel Modesto Mendez. From the pen of the
latter we have a written description accompanied by
drawings.<a id="FNanchor_IV-44" href="#Footnote_IV-44" class="fnanchor">[IV-44]</a> Unfortunately I have not been able to
examine the drawings made by Sr Mendez, whose text
is brief and, in some respects, unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TIKAL PALACES.</p>

<p>The chief feature at Tikal is the occurrence of many
palaces or temples of hewn stone in mortar, on the
summit of hills usually of slight elevation. Five of
these are specially mentioned, of which three are to
some extent described. The first is on a hill about
one hundred and forty feet high, natural like all the
rest so far as known, but covered in many places with
masonry. A stairway about seventy feet wide leads
up to the summit, on which stands a lofty stone palace,
or tower, seventy-two by twenty-four feet at the
base and eighty-six feet high, facing the east. The
walls of the lower portion, or what may be regarded
as the first story, are plain and coated with a hard
cement. There is a niche five or six feet deep in the
front, covered on the interior with paintings and hieroglyphics,
and furnished with wooden rings at the top,
as if for the suspension of curtains. At this point an
attempt to penetrate to the interior of the structure
showed the lower story to be solid, filled with earth
and stones. The upper story has an ornamented and
sculptured front, and there are ruins of a fallen balcony,
or more probably a staircase which formerly led
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
up to the entrance. Nothing is said of the interior of
the upper portion. The second structure is of the
same dimensions as the first, and is built on a hill opposite,
or eastward, which seems, however, to have no
steps upon its sides. It is much damaged and fallen,
but several of its rooms are well preserved, having
the triangular-arched roof of overlapping stones, walls
decorated with paintings and hieroglyphics, and corridors
six and a half feet wide and over one hundred
feet long, with windows, or air-holes, two and a half
by four feet. The walls are nearly seven feet thick,
and the top of the doorway at the entrance is of
rough zapote beams. The third palace differs in no
respect from the others, except that the zapote architrave
of the chief entrance is carved in ornamental
and hieroglyphic figures. In a kind of a court at the
foot of the hill in front of the first palace were found
eleven stone idols from five to six feet high. Three
of the number stood on large round stone disks, or
pedestals. About twenty of these disks, without
idols, were also found, seven or eight of which bore
indistinct medallion figures sculptured in low relief,
and the rest were rough and apparently unfinished.
Three oval stone disks were also dug out, as implied
by Mendez' text, from the excavation under the first
palace, although it is difficult to explain the presence
of sculptured relics in such a situation. One of the
stones measured five and a half by four by five and a
half feet, and bore on one side the figure of a woman
with decorated robe. The second bore the outlines
of a supposed god, and the third a figure which the
explorer profoundly concludes to have represented an
eagle or a snake, but which may perhaps be taken for
some other insect. On the road, just before reaching
the ruins, fragments of pottery were noticed, and Governor
Tut had also seen the figure of a bull well cut
from stone lying on the bank of a lagoon some eight
miles distant. It is evident that at or near Tikal
was formerly a large city, and when we consider the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
extent and importance of the ruins, the preceding description
unaccompanied by plates may seem meagre
and unsatisfactory. But after a perusal of the following
chapter on the ruins of Yucatan, the reader will
not fail to form a clear idea of those at Tikal; since
all that we know of the latter indicates clearly their
identity in style and in hieroglyphics with numerous
monuments of the peninsula further north. It is
therefore very probable that both groups are the
work of the same people, executed at approximately
the same epoch.</p>

<p>Colonel Mendez, while on his way to visit Tikal
for the second time in 1852, accidentally discovered
two other groups of ruins in the neighborhood of
Dolores, south-eastward from Lake Peten and at
about the same distance from the lake as Tikal. One
group is south-east and eight miles distant from Dolores,
and the other the same distance north-west.
The former is called by the natives Yxtutz, and the
latter Yxcum. There seem to have been made a description
and some drawings of the Dolores remains,
which I have not seen. Traces of walls are mentioned
and monoliths sculptured in high relief, with
figures resembling those at Copan and Quirigua rather
than those at Tikal, although the hieroglyphics are pronounced
identical with those of the latter monuments.
Other relics are the figure of a woman dressed in a
short nagua of feathers about the waist, fitting closely
and showing the form of the leg; and a collection of
sculptured blocks upon a round disk, on which are
carved hieroglyphics and figures of the sun and moon
with a prostrate human form before them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS IN BELIZE.</p>

<p>Near by on the Belize River is a cave in which
several idols were discovered, probably brought here
by the natives for concealment.<a id="FNanchor_IV-45" href="#Footnote_IV-45" class="fnanchor">[IV-45]</a> There are found in
the early Spanish annals of this region some accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of inhabited towns in this vicinity when the conquerors
first came, of which these ruins may be the
remains. I close the chapter on Guatemalan antiquities
with two short quotations, embodying all I
have been able to find respecting the ancient monuments
of the English province of Belize, on the Atlantic
coast eastward from Peten. "About thirty
miles up the Balize River, contiguous to its banks are
found, what in this country are denominated the Indian-hills.
These are small eminences, which are supposed
to have been raised by the aborigines over their dead;
human bones, and fragments of a coarse kind of earthen-ware,
being frequently dug from them. These Indian-hills
are seldom discovered but in the immediate
vicinity of rivers or creeks," and were therefore, perhaps,
built for refuge in time of floods. "The foot of
these hills is regularly planted round with large stones,
and the whole may perhaps be thought to bear a very
strong resemblance to the ancient barrows, or tumuli,
so commonly found in various parts of England."<a id="FNanchor_IV-46" href="#Footnote_IV-46" class="fnanchor">[IV-46]</a>
"I learned from a young Frenchman that on this
plantation (New Boston) are Indian ruins of the same
character as those of Yucatan, and that idols and other
antiquities have often been found there."<a id="FNanchor_IV-47" href="#Footnote_IV-47" class="fnanchor">[IV-47]</a></p>

</p>

<p class="sidenote">PHYSICAL FEATURES OF YUCATAN.</p>

<p>North of the bay of Chetumal on the Atlantic, the
Laguna de Terminos on the gulf of Mexico, and latitude
17° 50´ in the interior, lies the peninsula of
Yucatan, one of the few exceptions to the general
direction of the world's peninsulas, projecting north-eastwardly
from the continent, its form approximately
a parallelogram whose sides measure two hundred and
fifty miles from north to south and two hundred from
east to west. Its whole surface, so far as known to
geographers, may be termed practically a level plain
only slightly elevated above the level of the sea. The
coast for the most part, and especially in the north, is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
low, sandy, and barren, with few indentations affording
harbors, and correspondingly few towns and cities of
any importance. Crossing the narrow coast region,
however, we find the interior fertile and heavily
wooded. While there are no mountains that deserve
the name, yet there are not entirely wanting ranges of
hills to break up and diversify by their elevation of
from two hundred to five hundred feet the monotony
of a dead level. Chief among these is the Sierra de
Yucatan, so called, an offshoot of the southern Peten
heights, branching out from the great central Cordillera.
It stretches north-eastward nearly parallel with
the eastern coast to within some twenty-five miles of
Cape Catoche. Another line of hills on the opposite
gulf coast extends from the mouth of the River
Champoton, also north-eastward, toward Mérida, the
capital of the state, about thirty miles south-west of
which place it deflects abruptly at right angles from
its former direction, and with one or two parallel
minor ranges extends south-eastward at least half-way
across the state. At some period geologically recent
the waves of ocean and gulf doubtless beat against
this elbow-shaped sierra, then the coast barrier of the
peninsula; since the country lying to the north and
west presents everywhere in its limestone formation
traces of its comparatively late emergence from beneath
the sea. The lack of water on the surface is a
remarkable feature in the physical geography of Yucatan.
There are no rivers, and the few small streams
along the coast extend but few miles inland and disappear
as a rule in the dry season. One small lake,
whose waters are strongly impregnated with salt, is
the only body of water in the broad interior, which
is absolutely destitute of streams. From June to
October of each year rain falls in torrents, and the
sandy, calcareous soil seems to possess a wonderful
property of retaining the stored-up moisture, since the
ardent rays of the tropical sun beating down through
the long rainless summer months, rarely succeed in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
parching any portion of the surface into any approach
to the sterility of a desert. The summer temperature,
although high, is modified by sea-breezes from
the east and west; consequently the heat is less oppressive
and the climate on the whole more healthful
than in any other state of the American tierra caliente.
The inhabitants, something over half a million in number,
of whom a very large proportion are full-blooded
natives of the Maya race, are a quiet and peaceful
though brave people, living simply on the products of
the soil and of the forest, and each community taking
but little interest in the affairs of the world away from
their own immediate neighborhood. They made a
brave but vain resistance to the progress of foreign
conquerors, and have since lived for the most part in
quiet subjection to the power of a dominant race and
the priests of a foreign faith, having lost almost completely
the ambitious and haughty spirit for which
they were once noted, and forgotten practically the
greatness of their civilized ancestors. Since throwing
off the power of Spain, they have passed through
four or five revolutions,&mdash;a noteworthy record when
compared with that of other Spanish American states&mdash;by
which Yucatan has passed successively to and
fro from the condition of an independent republic to
that of a state in the Mexican Republic, to which it
now belongs. Except the northern central portion,
which contains the capital and principal towns, and
which itself, outside of Mérida and the route to the
coast, is only comparatively well known through the
writings of a few travelers, and except also some of
the ports along the coast visited occasionally by trading
vessels of various nations, Yucatan is still essentially
a terra incognita. It was more thoroughly
explored by the Spanish soldiers and priests in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than at any subsequent
time. The eastern interior and the southern
bordering on the Guatemalan province of Peten are
especially unexplored, little or nothing being known
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of the latter district away from the trails that lead
southward, one to Bacalar, the other to Lake Peten,
trodden by the feet of few but natives during the last
two centuries.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A RICH ANTIQUARIAN FIELD.</p>

<p>Yucatan presents a rich field for antiquarian exploration,
furnishing perhaps finer, and certainly more
numerous, specimens of ancient aboriginal architecture,
sculpture, and painting than have been discovered in
any other section of America. The state is literally
dotted, at least in the northern central, or best known,
portions with ruined edifices and cities. I shall have
occasion to mention, and describe more or less fully,
in this chapter, such ruins in between fifty and sixty
different localities.<a id="FNanchor_V-1" href="#Footnote_V-1" class="fnanchor">[V-1]</a> While these monuments, however,
are the most extensive and among the best preserved
within the limits of the Pacific States, they
were yet among the last to be brought to the knowledge
of the modern world. In the voyages, made
early in the sixteenth century, which immediately preceded
the conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards, Córdova,
Grijalva, and Cortés touched at various points
along the Yucatan coast, and were amazed to find
there on the borders of a new world which they had
supposed to be occupied exclusively by barbarians, a
civilized people who served their gods and kept their
idols in lofty stone temples. But their stay was
brief and they pursued their way northward, bent on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the conquest of the richer realms of Montezuma. The
excitement of the conquest and the new wonders beheld
in Anáhuac blotted practically from the popular
mind all memory of the southern tower-temples, although
their discovery was recorded in the diaries of
the expeditions, from which and from verbal descriptions
accounts were inserted in the works of the
standard historians of the Indies. Later, in the middle
of the century, when the turn came for Yucatan
to be overrun with soldiers, stone temples had become
too familiar sights to excite much attention; yet the
chroniclers of the time included in their annals some
brief descriptions of the heathen temples destroyed
by the Spanish invaders; and the Yucatan historians
of the following century, Landa, Cogolludo, and
Villagutierre Soto-Mayor, described and personally
visited some of the ruins. These earlier accounts
have been utilized in delineating the state of architectural
art among the Mayas in a preceding volume,
and they will also be used somewhat extensively as
illustrative material in the following pages. Since
these early times the ruins, shrouded by a dense tropical
vegetation, have lain untenanted and unknown,
save to the peaceful inhabitants of the northern and
more thickly settled portions of the state, who have
from time to time become aware of their existence
accidentally while in search of water or a favorable
locality for a milpa, or cornfield. Only a few of the
forty-four ruined towns explored by Mr Stephens were
known to exist by the people of Mérida, the state
capital.</p>

<p class="sidenote">EXPLORATION OF MAYA RUINS.</p>

<p class="sidenote">STEPHENS AND CATHERWOOD.</p>

<p>Since 1830 the veil has been lifted from the principal
ruins of ancient Maya works by the researches
of Zavala, Waldeck, Stephens, Catherwood, Norman,
Friederichsthal, and Charnay. A general account of
the antiquarian explorations and writings of these
gentlemen is given in the appended note,<a id="FNanchor_V-2" href="#Footnote_V-2" class="fnanchor">[V-2]</a> details and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
notices of additional visitors to particular localities
being reserved until I come to speak of those localities.
It will be noticed that all the authors mentioned
who write from actual observation, have confined
their observations to from one to four of the principal
ruins, whose existence was known previous to their
visits, excepting Messrs Stephens and Catherwood.
These gentlemen boldly left the beaten track and
brought to the knowledge of the world about forty
ruined cities whose very existence had been previously
unknown even to the residents of the larger cities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of the very state in whose territory they lie. With
a force of natives to aid in clearing away the forest,
Mr Stephens spent ten months in surveying, and Mr
Catherwood in sketching with the aid of a daguerrean
camera, the various groups of ruined structures. The
accuracy of both survey and drawings is unquestioned.
The visit of these explorers was the first, and has thus
far proved in most cases the last. The wrecks of Maya
architecture have been left to slumber undisturbed in
their forest winding-sheet. "For a brief space the
stillness that reigned around them was broken, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
they were again left to solitude and silence. Time
and the elements are hastening them to utter destruction.
It has been the fortune of the author to step
between them and the entire destruction to which
they are destined; and it is his hope to snatch from
oblivion these perishing, but still gigantic memorials
of a mysterious people." His hope has been fully realized,
and his book may be regarded as a model, both
as a journal of travel and personal adventure and as
a record of antiquarian research. Mr Stephens is one
of the very few travelers who have been able to gaze
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
upon the noble monuments of a past civilization without
being drawn into a maze of absurd reasoning and
conjecture respecting their builders. His conclusions,
if sometimes incorrect in the opinion of other antiquarians
entitled to a hearing in the matter, are never
groundless or rashly formed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extent of Mr Stephens' explorations,
a very large part of Yucatan remains yet
untrodden by the antiquary's foot. This is especially
true in the east, except on the immediate coast,
and in the south toward Guatemala. That extensive
ruins yet lie hidden in these unexplored regions, can
hardly be doubted; indeed, it is by no means certain
that the grandest cities, even in the settled and partially
explored part of the peninsula, have yet been
described; but the uniformity of such as have been
brought to our knowledge does not lead us to expect
new developments with respect to the nature, whatever
may be proved of the extent, of the Maya antiquities.</p>

<p>By reason of the level surface of the peninsula,
uncut by rivers, and unbroken by mountain ranges,
the determination of the geographical position of its
ruins is reduced to a statement of distances and bearings.
The location of the chief cities is moreover
indicated on the map which accompanies this volume.<a id="FNanchor_V-3" href="#Footnote_V-3" class="fnanchor">[V-3]</a>
With respect to the order in which they are to be described
there would be little ground for preference in
favor of any particular arrangement, were they all
equally well known. But this is not the case. Two
or three of the principal cities have been carefully examined,
described, and sketched, and as for the rest,
only their points of contrast with the preceding have
been pointed out. All that is known of most of the
ruins would be wholly unintelligible at the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of my description, but will be found comparatively
satisfactory further on. Thus I am not only
obliged to describe the best-known ruins first, but fortunately
these are also among the grandest and most
typical of the whole, being, in fact, the very ones that
would be selected for the purpose. To fully describe
a few and point out contrasts in the rest is the only
method of avoiding a very tiresome monotony in
attempting to make known some hundreds of structures
very like one to another in most of their details
as well as in their general features. The similarity
observed among the different monuments is a very
great advantage to the antiquarian student, since it
will enable me, if I mistake not, to give the reader
in this chapter as clear an idea of the antiquities of
Yucatan, notwithstanding their great number, as of
any portion of the Pacific States.</p>

<p class="sidenote">GROUPS OF RUINS.</p>

<p>For convenience in description, then, I divide the
ruins in the interior of the state into four groups; the
central group,&mdash;placed first that I may begin my
account with Uxmal&mdash;which, besides the extensive
ruins of Uxmal, Kabah, and Labná, embraces relics
of the past in at least nineteen other localities; the
eastern group, including little besides the famous
ruins at Chichen Itza; the northern group, in which
I mention Izamal, Aké, Mérida, and Mayapan; and
the southern group, comprising five or six ruined towns
in the region of Iturbide. I shall finally treat of the
antiquities discovered at various points on the eastern
and western coasts.</p>

<p>The parallel ranges of hills already spoken of as
extending half-way across the peninsula from north-west
to south-east contain within their enclosed valleys
the ruins of the first group, more numerous than
in any other section of the state, and all comprised
within a parallelogram whose sides would measure
about thirty and forty miles respectively.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF UXMAL.</p>

<p>Uxmal is the most north-western of the group, in
latitude 20° 27´ 30´´, thirty-five miles south of Mérida,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
on a hacienda belonging, by a deed running back one
hundred and forty years, thirty-five years ago,&mdash;and
very likely still, as real estate rarely changes hands
in Spanish American countries,&mdash;to the Peon family,
and at one time cultivated by its owners as a cornfield.<a id="FNanchor_V-4" href="#Footnote_V-4" class="fnanchor">[V-4]</a>
The derivation and meaning of the name Uxmal,<a id="FNanchor_V-5" href="#Footnote_V-5" class="fnanchor">[V-5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
like that of so many American cities of the past,
is unknown; it is even uncertain whether this was the
name of the city at all in the days of its original
greatness, or only an appellation derived from that of
the hacienda on which it stands, in comparatively
modern times. Waldeck and some other writers take
the latter view, identifying the ruins themselves with
the city of Itzalane, ancient capital of the Itzas, although
the authorities indicate only very vaguely that
a city named Itzalane ever existed. Brasseur de
Bourbourg, on the contrary, believes it to have been,
under its present name of Uxmal, the capital of the
Tutul Xius in the ninth century; Mr Stephens also
believes that Uxmal was an inhabited city down to
the days of the conquest.<a id="FNanchor_V-6" href="#Footnote_V-6" class="fnanchor">[V-6]</a> The ruins are situated in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the foothills of one of the ranges mentioned, notwithstanding
which fact the locality seems to be one of
the most unhealthy in the state. Fever and ague,
especially during the rainy season, and ravenous mosquitos
have ever been the chief obstacles encountered
by travelers. The vegetation, although dense and of
the usual rapid growth, has been a lesser hindrance
here than in many other localities, by reason of the
ruins' proximity to a hacienda and the frequent clearings
made.<a id="FNanchor_V-7" href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">[V-7]</a></p>

<p>The exact extent of the ruins it is of course impossible
to determine, since the whole region abounds with
mounds and heaps of débris scattered in every direction
through the adjoining forest,<a id="FNanchor_V-8" href="#Footnote_V-8" class="fnanchor">[V-8]</a> and belonging originally
to Uxmal or to some city in its immediate
vicinity. A rectangular space, however, measuring in
general terms something over one third of a mile from
north to south and one fourth of a mile from east to
west would include all the principal structures. The
annexed plan will show their arrangement within the
rectangle, as well as their ground forms and dimensions
more clearly than many pages of descriptive
text. Except in a few instances I have not attempted
on the plan to represent the grades of the various terraces,
which will be made clear in the text, but have
indicated the extent of their bases by dotted lines and
by the omission of the foliage which covers their sides
and platforms as well as the surrounding country.<a id="FNanchor_V-9" href="#Footnote_V-9" class="fnanchor">[V-9]</a> It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
will be seen at a glance by the reader that none of
the structures face exactly the cardinal points, and
that no two of them face exactly in the same direction.
It is customary for writers on American antiquities
to speak of all the principal ruined palaces and
temples as exactly oriented, and all the visitors to
Uxmal, except Stephens, make the same statement
respecting its structures, or so represent them on their
plans. But in this case we are left in no uncertainty
in the matter, for a photographic view of the southern
ruins from the courtyard of the building C, agrees
exactly with Stephens' plan, and proves beyond question
that the structures A and C, at least, cannot lie
in the same direction.<a id="FNanchor_V-10" href="#Footnote_V-10" class="fnanchor">[V-10]</a> To prove that any of them
face the cardinal points will require more careful examination
than has yet been made.</p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CASA DEL GOBERNADOR.</p>

<p>In the southern central portion of the space comprised
in the plan is the edifice at A, known as the
Casa del Gobernador, or Governor's House. It may
be remarked here that the names by which the different
structures are known have been given them, generally
by the natives, but sometimes by visitors, in
accordance with what they have fancied to have been
their original use. There is only a very slight probability
that in a few cases they may have hit upon a
correct designation, although many of the names, like
that of this building, are certainly sufficiently appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_V-11" href="#Footnote_V-11" class="fnanchor">[V-11]</a>
The terraced mound that supports the Governor's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
house demands our first attention. Its base,
with its irregularities in form on the west and south,
is shown on the plan by the dotted lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>:
and measures on its perfect sides, <i>ab</i>, and <i>bc</i>, about
six hundred feet. At a height of three feet from the
ground a terrace, or promenade, mostly destroyed at
the time of observation and not indicated on the plan,
extends round the mound. From this rises the second
terrace to a height of twenty feet, supporting a
platform whose sides measure five hundred and forty-five
feet. Somewhat west of the centre of this platform
rises the third terrace, nineteen feet high and
supporting the summit platform <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, whose
dimensions are about one hundred by three hundred
and sixty feet, and whose height above the original
surface of the ground is something over forty feet.<a id="FNanchor_V-12" href="#Footnote_V-12" class="fnanchor">[V-12]</a>
The material of the body of this mound is rough fragments
of limestone thrown together without any order;
the terraces are supported, however, at the sides by
solid walls built of regular blocks of hewn limestone
carefully laid in mortar nearly as hard as the rock.
So far as can be determined from the drawings, these
walls are not perpendicular, but incline slightly inward
towards the top, and the corners are not square but
carefully rounded. It is not improbable that the platforms
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
were also paved originally with square blocks,
as M. Charnay believes, although now covered with
soil and vegetation. By means of an excavation, solid
stone was found in the interior above the surface
level, showing that the builders had taken advantage
of a natural elevation as a labor-saving expedient in
heaping up this massive artificial stone mound. There
are no traces of stairways by which access was had to
the second platform,<a id="FNanchor_V-13" href="#Footnote_V-13" class="fnanchor">[V-13]</a> but a long inclined plane without
steps, one hundred feet wide, on the southern side,
apparently furnished the only means of ascent. From
the second platform, however, a regular stairway of
thirty-five steps, one hundred and thirty feet wide,
leads up to the summit at <i>i</i>, being in the centre of the
eastern side, or front.</p>

<img src="images/i157.jpg" width="487" height="321" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Section of the Casa del Gobernador.</p>
</div>

<p>The upper platform supports, and forms a promenade
thirty feet wide round the Casa del Gobernador,
which is a building three hundred and twenty-two
feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, and twenty-six feet
high,<a id="FNanchor_V-14" href="#Footnote_V-14" class="fnanchor">[V-14]</a> built of stone and mortar. A central wall
divides the interior longitudinally into two nearly
equal corridors, which, divided again by transverse
partition walls, form two parallel rows of rooms extending
the whole length of the building. The
arrangement of these rooms will be best understood by
a reference to the accompanying ground plan from Mr
Stephens.<a id="FNanchor_V-15" href="#Footnote_V-15" class="fnanchor">[V-15]</a> The two central apartments are about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
sixty feet long and twelve feet wide; the others, except
the two in the recesses, are twelve by twenty-five
feet. Those of the front corridor are twenty-three
feet high, while in the rear they are only twenty-two,
authorities differing somewhat, however, on this point.
There are two doorways in the rear, one on each end,
and thirteen on the front; with nine interior doorways
exactly opposite the same number on the exterior.
The rear, or western wall, except for a short distance
at each end, is nine feet thick and perfectly solid, as
was proved by an excavation; the transverse walls
corresponding with the two recesses are of about the
same thickness; and all the other walls are between
two and three feet thick. The stone for the facings
of the whole building is cut in smooth blocks nearly
cubic in form and of varying but nowhere exactly
stated dimensions; but the mass of the structure, as
is proven by M. Charnay's photograph, is an agglomeration
of rough, irregular fragments of stone in mortar.
The construction of the whole will be understood
by a glance at the cut, which represents a section
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the building at the central doorway in very nearly
its true proportions, although the proper size and
cubical form of the blocks are not observed.<a id="FNanchor_V-16" href="#Footnote_V-16" class="fnanchor">[V-16]</a> At
about mid-height of each room the side walls begin
to approach each other, one layer of stones overlapping
the one below it, until they are only one foot
apart, when a number of blocks, longer than usual, are
laid across the top, serving by means of the mortar
which holds them in place and the weight of the
superimposed masonry, as key-stones to this arch
of the true American type. The projecting corners
of the overlapping blocks are beveled off so that the
ceiling presents two plane stone surfaces nearly forming
an acute angle at the top. Above and between
these arches all is solid masonry to the flat roof,
giving to the apartments the air of galleries excavated
in the solid mass, rather than enclosed by
walls. The top of each doorway is formed by a
stout beam of zapote-wood which has to bear the
weight of the stone-work above. One of these lintels
in the southern apartment, ten feet long, twenty-one
inches wide, and ten inches thick, is elaborately
carved; the rest, not only in this building, but in all
at Uxmal, are plain.<a id="FNanchor_V-17" href="#Footnote_V-17" class="fnanchor">[V-17]</a> Many of them are broken and
fallen. It is to the breaking of these wooden lintels
that is to be attributed nearly all the dilapidation observable
about this ruin, especially over the outer
doorways. Some special motive must have influenced
the builders to use wood in preference to the more
durable stone, and this motive may be supposed to
have been the rarity and value of the zapote, which
is said not to grow in this part of the state. The
only traces preserved of the means by which these
doorways were originally closed are the remains, on
the inside of some of them near the top, of rings, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
hooks, which may have served as hinges, or more
probably for the support of a bar from which to suspend
curtains. The dimensions of the doorways are
not stated, but they are about ten feet high and seven
feet wide. They are the only openings into or between
the apartments, there being absolutely no windows,
chimneys, or air-holes. Across the ceilings from
side to side at about mid-height stretch small wooden
beams, whose ends are built into the stone-work. The
only suggestions respecting their use are that they
served to support the ceilings while in process of construction,
and that they served for the suspension of
hammocks.<a id="FNanchor_V-18" href="#Footnote_V-18" class="fnanchor">[V-18]</a> The inner surface of the rooms is that
of the plain smooth stone blocks, except in one or two
of them where a very thin coating of fine white plaster
is noticed. There is no trace of painting, sculpture,
or other attempt at decoration. The floors and
roof are covered with a hard cement. Nothing further
worthy of particular notice demands our attention in
the interior of the Governor's House, except the
small apartments corresponding with the recesses near
each end of the building. In these the sides of the
ceiling instead of beginning to approach each other by
means of overlapping blocks at mid-height of the
room, begin at or near the floor, thus leaving no perpendicular
walls whatever. The explanation of this
seems to be, so far as can be judged from Catherwood's
drawing and Charnay's photograph, that originally
an open passage about twenty feet wide at the
bottom, narrowing to two or three feet at the top, and
twenty-four feet high, extended completely through
the building from front to rear at each of the recesses,
and that afterwards this passage was divided into two
small apartments by three partition walls, a small
door being left in the front and rear.<a id="FNanchor_V-19" href="#Footnote_V-19" class="fnanchor">[V-19]</a></p>

<p>It now only remains to notice the exterior of the
walls. A cornice just above the doorway, at something
over one third of the height of the building,
surrounds the entire structure, and another cornice is
found near the top. Below the lower cornice the
walls present the plain surface of the smoothly cut
cubes of limestone, no traces of plaster or paint appearing.
Above the cornice the walls are covered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
with elegant and complicated sculpture. The preceding
cut<a id="FNanchor_V-20" href="#Footnote_V-20" class="fnanchor">[V-20]</a> presents a view of the south end, and
gives an idea of the sculptured portion of the wall,
although it must be remembered that both the ends
and rear are much less elaborately decorated than the
front. The whole surface is divided into squares, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
panels, filled alternately with frets, or grecques, and
diamond lattice-work, with specially elaborate ornaments
over each doorway, in connection with some of
which are characters presumably hieroglyphic. The
three cuts<a id="FNanchor_V-21" href="#Footnote_V-21" class="fnanchor">[V-21]</a> show the ornamentation over the central
front doorway. The first represents what seems to
have been a human figure seated and surmounted by
a lofty plumed head-dress. These human statues occurred
in several places along the front, probably over
each door, but few fragments remained to be seen by
Europeans, and most of these have long since entirely
disappeared. The second cut represents that part of
the decoration extending above that before pictured
to the upper cornice along the top of the wall. The
central portion of this ornament is a curved projection,
supposed, by more than one traveler, to be modeled
after the trunk of an elephant, of which a profile
view is shown in the third cut. It projects nineteen
inches from the surface of the wall. This protruding
curve occurs more frequently on this and other buildings
at Uxmal than any other decoration, and usually
with the same or similar accompaniments, which may be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
fancied to represent the features of a monster, of which
this forms the nose. It occurs especially on the ornamented
and rounded corners; being sometimes reversed
in its position, and having, with few exceptions,
the point broken off, probably by the natives, from
superstitious motives, to prevent the long-nosed monster
from walking abroad at night.<a id="FNanchor_V-22" href="#Footnote_V-22" class="fnanchor">[V-22]</a> The ornaments
are cut on square blocks, which are inserted in the
wall, one block containing only a part of the ornamental
design. Of course, a verbal description fails
utterly in conveying any proper idea of this front,
whose sculptured decorations, if less elaborate and
complicated than some others in Yucatan, are surpassed
by none in elegant grandeur. I append however,
in a note, some quotations respecting this façade,
and take leave of the Casa del Gobernador with a
mention of the 'red hand,' whose imprint is found on
stones in all parts of the building. Mr Stephens believes
that it was made by the pressure of a small human
hand, smeared with red paint, upon the surface
of the wall.<a id="FNanchor_V-23" href="#Footnote_V-23" class="fnanchor">[V-23]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>This magnificent palace, whose description I have
given, may be regarded as a representative, in its general
features and many of its details, of the ancient
Maya structures, very few of which, however, are so
well preserved as this. Consequently, over this type
of ruins&mdash;long, low, narrow buildings, with flat roofs,
divided into a double line of small rooms, with triangular-arched
ceilings, plain interior walls, and cement
floors; the whole supported by a stone mound, ascended
by a broad stairway&mdash;I shall be able in future
to pass more briefly, simply noting such points of contrast
with the Casa del Gobernador as may occur.
Still some of the other buildings of Uxmal have received
more attention from visitors, and consequently
will afford better illustrations of some of the common
features than the one already described.</p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CASA DE TORTUGAS.</p>

<p>On the north-west corner of the second platform of
the same mound that supports the Governor's House,
and lying in a direction perpendicular to that building,
is the small structure marked B on the plan, and
known as the Casa de Tortugas, or Turtle House.
It is ninety-four feet long, thirty-four feet wide, and,
as nearly as can be estimated by Charnay's photograph,
about twenty feet high. The roof, in an insecure condition
at the time of Mr Stephens' first visit, had
fallen in before the second, filling up the interior, concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
which consequently nothing is known. The
central portion of the southern wall, corresponding with
the three doorways on that side, had also fallen, and
on the northern side was ready to fall, the wooden
lintel of the only doorway being broken. At the time
of Charnay's visit neither the centre nor western end
of the northern wall remained standing. The exterior
walls below the lower cornice are plain, as in the Casa
del Gobernador, but between the cornices, instead of
the complicated sculpture of the former building, there
appears a simple and elegant line of round columns
standing close together and encircling the whole edifice.
Each of these columns is composed of two or
three pieces of stone one upon another, and although
presenting outwardly a half-round surface, they are
undoubtedly square on the side that is built into the
wall. Above the upper cornice is a row of turtles,
occurring at regular intervals, sculptured each on a
square block which projects from the wall; hence the
name of the building. It is noted as a remarkable
circumstance that no stairway leads up the terrace to
this building from the surface below, or from it to the
Governor's House above.<a id="FNanchor_V-23b" href="#Footnote_V-23b" class="fnanchor">[V-23]</a></p>

<p>At different points on the second, or grand, platform
of the mound supporting the Casa del Gobernador
are traces of structures which once stood there, but
insufficient in every case, except in that of the
Tortugas, to give any idea of their original nature.
Standing at the foot of one of these old foundation
walls three hundred feet long, fifteen feet wide, and
three feet high, on the south side of the platform, at
<i>j</i>, is a range of broken round columns, each five feet
high and eighteen inches in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_V-24" href="#Footnote_V-24" class="fnanchor">[V-24]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>On the same platform, about eighty feet eastward
of the central stairway, at <i>k</i>, is a round stone standing
eight feet above the ground in a leaning position.
It is rudely formed, has no sculpture on its surface,
and is surrounded by a small square enclosure two
stones high. The natives call it <i>picote</i>, 'stone of
punishment,' or 'whipping-post.' Its prominent and
central position in front of the magnificent palace, indicates
its great importance in the eyes of the ancient
Mayas, and Mr Stephens thinks it may be a phallus,
not without reason, since apparent traces of an ancient
phallic worship will be found not unfrequently among
the Yucatan ruins.<a id="FNanchor_V-25" href="#Footnote_V-25" class="fnanchor">[V-25]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;PICOTE AND IDOL.</p>

<p>Sixty feet further eastward, at <i>l</i>, was a circular
mound of earth and stones about sixty feet in
height, opened by Mr Stephens, who brought to
light a double-headed stone animal, three feet long
and two feet high, which had been buried there, very
probably for the purpose of concealment. Being too
heavy for convenient removal, it was left standing in
the same position as when buried, and has there been
noticed by several subsequent observers. Its sculpture
is rude, and but slightly damaged by time. It is
shown in the cut on the next page, with the picote, the
stairway, and the front of the Governor's House in the
distance.<a id="FNanchor_V-26" href="#Footnote_V-26" class="fnanchor">[V-26]</a> One hundred and thirty feet from this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
two-headed idol, in a direction not stated, Mr Stephens
found a structure twenty feet square at the
base, from which were dug out two sculptured heads,
apparently portraits. The only objects of interest
which remain to be noticed in connection with this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
platform, or the mound-structure of which it forms a
part, are two excavations, supposed to have been originally
cisterns. The entrance, or mouth, to each is a
circular opening, eighteen inches in diameter, lined
with regular blocks of cut stone, and descending three
feet, vertically, from the surface of the platform, before
it begins to widen into a dome-shaped chamber.
The dimensions of the chambers could not be ascertained
because they were nearly filled with rubbish,
but similar chambers are of frequent occurrence
throughout the city of Uxmal and vicinity, several of
which were found unencumbered with débris, and in
perfect preservation. They were all dome-shaped, or
rather of the shape of a well-formed hay-stack, as Mr
Stevens expresses it, the bottoms being somewhat
contracted. The walls and floor were carefully plastered.
One of these cisterns measured ten and a half
feet deep and seventeen and a half feet in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_V-27" href="#Footnote_V-27" class="fnanchor">[V-27]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CISTERNS AND PYRAMID.</p>

<p>At the south-west corner of the Casa del Gobernador,
and even intrenching on the terraces that support
it, is the pyramid E, to which strangely enough no
name has been given. It has in fact received but
very slight attention; one short visit by Mr Stephens,
during which he mounted to the summit with a force
of Indians, being the only one recorded, although it
is barely mentioned by others. This pyramid measures
two hundred by three hundred feet at the base,
and its height is sixty-five feet. At the top is a
square platform, whose sides are each seventy-five
feet. The area of this platform is flat, composed of
rough stones, and has no traces whatever of ever having
supported any building. Its sides, however, three
feet high perpendicularly, are of hewn blocks of stone,
and smooth with ornamented corners. Below this summit
platform, for a distance of ten or twelve feet, the
sides of the pyramid are faced with sculptured stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the ornaments being chiefly grecques, like those on the
Governor's House, having one of the immense faces
with projecting teeth at the centre of the western side.
At this point Mr Stephens attempted an excavation
in the hope of discovering interior apartments, but the
only result was to prostrate himself with an attack of
fever, which obliged him to quit Uxmal. Just below
this sculptured upper border, some fifteen feet below
the top, a narrow terrace extends round the four sides
of the pyramid. Concerning the surface below this
terrace, we only know that it is encased in stone, and
would very probably reveal additional ornamentation
if subjected to a more minute examination.<a id="FNanchor_V-28" href="#Footnote_V-28" class="fnanchor">[V-28]</a> The
pyramid F, still farther south-west, is two hundred
feet long and one hundred and twenty feet wide at
the base, being about fifty feet high. These particulars,
together with the fact that a stairway leads up
the northern slope, to one of the typical Yucatan
buildings, twenty by one hundred feet and divided
into three apartments, are absolutely all that has
been recorded of this structure, which, like its more
imposing companion pyramid, has not been thought
worthy of a name. The reader will be able to form a
more consistent conjecture respecting its original appearance
after reading a description in the following
pages of the structure at D, which presents some
points of apparent similarity to its more modest
southern neighbor.<a id="FNanchor_V-29" href="#Footnote_V-29" class="fnanchor">[V-29]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CASA DE PALOMAS.</p>

<p>Northward from the last pyramid, and connected
with it by a courtyard one hundred feet long and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
eighty-five feet wide, with ranges of undescribed ruins
on the east and west, are the buildings at G, built
round and enclosing a courtyard one hundred and
eighty feet long and one hundred and fifty feet wide,
entered through an archway in the centre of the
northern and southern buildings. This courtyard has
a picote in the centre, like that before the Governor's
House, but fallen. These buildings are in an advanced
state of ruin and no details are given respecting
any of them except the northern one, which presents
one remarkable feature. Along the centre of
the roof from east to west throughout the whole length
of two hundred and forty feet, is a peculiar wall rising
in peaks like saw-teeth. These are nine in number,
each about twenty-seven feet long at the base, between
fifteen and twenty feet high, and three feet thick.
Each is pierced with many oblong openings arranged
in five or six horizontal rows, one above another like
the windows in the successive stories of a modern
building, or like those of a pigeon house, or Casa de
Palomas, by which name it is known. Traces yet remain
which show that originally these strange elevations
were covered with stucco ornaments, the only instance
of stucco decorations in Uxmal. Of this group
of structures, including the two courtyards and the
pyramid beyond, notwithstanding their ruined condition,
Mr Stephens remarks that "they give a stronger
impression of departed greatness than anything else
in this desolate city."<a id="FNanchor_V-30" href="#Footnote_V-30" class="fnanchor">[V-30]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the remains marked 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
14, and 15, on the plan, north of the Pyramid and Casa
de Palomas, and west of the Casa del Gobernador, all
that can be said is embodied in the following quotation:
"A vast range of high, ruined terraces, facing
east and west, nearly eight hundred feet long at the
base, and called the Campo Santo. On one of these
is a building of two stories, with some remains of sculpture,
and in a deep and overgrown valley at the foot,
the Indians say, was the burial-place of this ancient
city; but, though searching for it ourselves, and offering
a reward to them for the discovery, we never found
in it a sepulchre."<a id="FNanchor_V-31" href="#Footnote_V-31" class="fnanchor">[V-31]</a></p>

<p>Crossing over now to the eastward of the Governor's
House, we find a small group of ruins in the
south-eastern corner of the rectangle. The one marked
6 on the plan is known as the Casa de la Vieja, or Old
Woman's House, so named from a statue that was
found lying near its front. The building stands on
the summit of a small pyramid and its walls were just
ready to fall at the time of the survey. Of the other
structures of the group, 5 and 7, no further information
is given than that which may be gathered from
the plan. Along the line marked 4, 4, 4, are slight
traces of a continuous wall, indicating that Uxmal
may have been a walled city, since no careful search
has ever been made for such traces in other portions of
the city's circumference.<a id="FNanchor_V-32" href="#Footnote_V-32" class="fnanchor">[V-32]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL GYMNASIUM.</p>

<p>To go from the Casa del Gobernador northward to
the buildings at C and D, yet to be described, we pass
between two parallel walls at H. These two parallel
structures are solid masses of rough stones faced on
all four sides with smoothly cut blocks, and were, so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
far as can be determined in their present condition,
exactly alike. Each measures thirty by one hundred
and twenty-eight feet on the ground, and they are
seventy feet apart, their height not being given. The
fronts which face each other were covered with sculptured
decorations, now mostly fallen, including two entwined
serpents; while from the centre of each of these
façades projected originally a stone ring about four
feet in diameter, fixed in the wall by means of a tenon.
Both are broken, and the fragments for the most part
lost. A similar building in a better state of preservation
will be noticed among the ruins of Chichen Itza,
in describing which a cut of one of the stone rings will
be given. It is easy to imagine that the grand promenade
between the northern and southern palaces, or
temples, was along a line that passed between these
walls, and that these sculptured fronts and rings were
important in connection with religious rites and processions
of priests. The chief entrance to the northern
buildings is in a line with this passage, and it seems
strange that we find no corresponding stairway leading
up the southern terrace to the front of the Casa de
Tortugas.<a id="FNanchor_V-33" href="#Footnote_V-33" class="fnanchor">[V-33]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CASA DE MONJAS.</p>

<p>Between two and three hundred yards north from
the Casa del Gobernador, is the Casa de Monjas, or
Nunnery, marked C on the plan. This is perhaps the
most wonderful edifice, or collection of edifices, in
Yucatan, if not the finest specimen of aboriginal architecture
and sculpture in America. The supporting
mound, whose base is indicated by the dotted lines
<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i> is in general terms three hundred and
fifty feet square, and nineteen feet high, its sides very
nearly facing the cardinal points. The southern, or
front, slope of the mound, about seventy feet wide, rises
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
in three grades, or terraces, three, twelve, and four
feet high, and twenty, forty-five, and five feet wide,
respectively, from the base. There are some traces of
a wide central stairway leading up to the second terrace
on this side, but none of the steps remain in place.</p>

<p>On this platform stand four of the typical Yucatan
edifices built round a courtyard, with unequal intervals
between them at the corners. The southern
building is two hundred and seventy-nine feet long,
twenty-eight feet wide, and eighteen feet high; the
northern building, two hundred and sixty-four feet
long, twenty-eight feet wide, and twenty-five feet
high; the eastern, one hundred and fifty-eight by thirty-five
feet, and twenty-two feet high; the western, one
hundred and seventy-three by thirty-five feet, and
twenty feet high.<a id="FNanchor_V-34" href="#Footnote_V-34" class="fnanchor">[V-34]</a> The northern building stands on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
terrace of its own, which rises about twenty feet above
the general level of the main platform on which the
others stand. The court formed by the four edifices
measures two hundred and fifty-eight by two hundred
and fourteen feet. It is two feet and a half lower
than the foundations of the eastern, western, and
southern buildings, and traces of low steps may yet
be seen running the whole length of the sides. Its
area is paved with stone, much worn by long usage.
M. Waldeck, by diligent research or by an effort of
his imagination, found that each of the forty-three
thousand six hundred and sixty blocks composing the
pavement was six inches square, and had the figure of
a turtle sculptured on its upper surface. Stephens
could find no traces of the turtles, and believes that
the pavement was originally covered with cement.<a id="FNanchor_V-35" href="#Footnote_V-35" class="fnanchor">[V-35]</a>
In the centre are the fragments of a rude column,
picote, or phallus, like those found in connection with
the Casa del Gobernador and Casa de Palomas. M.
Charnay also found traces of a straight path with
raised borders leading north and south across the centre,
and also two of the dome-shaped cisterns already
described.<a id="FNanchor_V-36" href="#Footnote_V-36" class="fnanchor">[V-36]</a></p>

<p>The situation of the four structures forming the
quadrangle, and the division of each into apartments,
are shown in the accompanying ground plan.<a id="FNanchor_V-37" href="#Footnote_V-37" class="fnanchor">[V-37]</a>

<p class="caption">Interior of Room&mdash;Casa de Monjas.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the northern building of the
Nunnery does not stand exactly in the same direction
as the sides of the platform or of the other edifices,
an arrangement which detracts somewhat from the
symmetry of the group. Each of the four buildings
is divided longitudinally into two parallel ranges
of apartments, arranged very much like those of the
Governor's House, with doorways opening on the interior
court. The only exterior doorways are on the
front of the southern building and on the ends of the
northern; these, however, only afford access to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
outer range of rooms, which do not communicate with
the interior. In only one instance do more than two
rooms communicate with each other, and that is in the
centre of the eastern building, where are two communicating
apartments, the largest in the Nunnery, each
thirteen by thirty-three feet, with an ante-room at
each end measuring nine by thirteen feet. All the
doorways of this suite are decorated with sculpture,
the only instance of interior stone-carving in Uxmal.
The cut on the next page shows the inside of one of
the larger rooms of this suite, and also gives an excellent
idea of the interior of all the structures of Yucatan.<a id="FNanchor_V-38" href="#Footnote_V-38" class="fnanchor">[V-38]</a>
The rooms of the Casa de Monjas, eighty-eight
in number, like some in the Casa del Gobernador, are
plastered with a thin coat of hard white material
like plaster of Paris. Those of the southern building
average twenty-four feet long, ten feet wide, and seventeen
feet high. They all present the same general
features of construction&mdash;angular-arched ceilings,
wooden lintels, stone rings, or hinges, on the inside of
the doorways, holes in the sloping ceilings for hammock-timbers,
entire absence of any openings except
the doors&mdash;that have been previously described.<a id="FNanchor_V-39" href="#Footnote_V-39" class="fnanchor">[V-39]</a>
The platform on which the buildings stand forms a
narrow promenade, only five or six feet in width, round
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
each, both on the exterior and on the court. The entrance
to the court is by a gateway, at <i>v</i> on the general
plan, in the centre of the southern building. It
is ten feet and eight inches wide and about fourteen
feet high, the top being formed by the usual triangular
arch, and the whole being similar to the passages
through the Casa del Gobernador before the latter
were walled up. Opposite this gateway, at <i>w</i>, a stairway
ninety-five feet wide leads up to the upper terrace
which supports the northern building. On each side
of this stairway, at <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, on the slope of the terrace, is
a ruin of the usual construction, in which six small
apartments may be traced. The dilapidation of these
buildings is so great that it is impossible to ascertain
whether they were independent structures or formed
a part of the terrace itself, a mode of construction of
which we shall find some specimens in Yucatan, and
even at Uxmal. A noticeable peculiarity in the northern
building is that, wherever the outer walls are
fallen, the sculptured surface of an inner wall is disclosed,
showing that the edifice in its present form
was built over an older structure.</p>

<p>Nothing remains to be said respecting the general
plan and construction of the Nunnery, or of the interior
of the apartments which compose it: and I
now come to the exterior walls. The sides and ends
of each building are, like those already described,
plain and unplastered below the cornice, which extends
round the whole circumference just above the
doorways. Above this cornice the whole surface,
over twenty-four thousand square feet for the four
buildings, is covered with elegant and elaborate sculptured
decorations. The four interior façades fronting
on the court are pronounced by all beholders the chef-d'&oelig;uvres
of aboriginal decorative art in America, being
more chaste and artistic, and at the same time
less complicated and grotesque, than any other fronts
in Yucatan. All have been carefully studied, sketched,
or photographed. No two of them are alike, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
even similar. The outer fronts received somewhat
less care at the hands of the native builders, and consequently
less attention from modern visitors, being
moreover much more seriously affected by the ravages
of time and the elements.</p>

<p class="caption">Detail of Southern Court Façade.</p>
</div>

<p>I begin with the southern building, showing in the
accompanying engraving the eastern third of its court
façade, the other portions being precisely like that
which is represented. Except over the doorways the
space between the cornices is occupied by diamond
lattice-work and vertical columns, small portions being
left, however, entirely plain. Some of the columns
have central moldings corresponding nearly in
form to the cornices.<a id="FNanchor_V-40" href="#Footnote_V-40" class="fnanchor">[V-40]</a> The central gateway is not
shown in the engraving, but there is no special ornamentation
in connection with it, its border being of
lattice-work, according to Waldeck, or of plain blocks,
according to Charnay, contrary to what might be expected
over the only entrance to so grand a court.
The next engraving shows a portion of the same façade
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
on a larger scale, including the ornament which
is repeated over each door. This ornament seems to
represent a small house with a roof of thatch or tiles,
having a human figure seated in a niche in the wall,
which corresponds with the doorway of the house.
This seated statue had disappeared before the visits
of later explorers. That a statue once occupied the
niche there can be no doubt. Whether M. Waldeck
sketched it from actual observation or from the report
of the natives, is not quite so clear. The last-named
writer advances two original and somewhat remarkable
theories respecting these small houses; first, that
they may be taken as a representation of the houses
actually occupied by the common people at the time
Uxmal was built; and second, that they are identical
with the Aztec sign <i>calli</i>, 'house,' from which he derives
an argument respecting the probable age of the
building, which will be noticed in its place. M. Charnay
calls this front the <span xml:lang="fr">Façade des Abeilles</span>, or Bee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
front, while M. Waldeck terms the building the
Temple of the Asterisms. The exterior, or southern,
front of this building is similar to the northern, but
somewhat plainer, having, however, the same houses
and niches over the doorways.<a id="FNanchor_V-41" href="#Footnote_V-41" class="fnanchor">[V-41]</a></p>

<p>The court façade of the eastern building, which has
been called the Sun front, and also the Egyptian front,
is perhaps more tasteful in its sculptured ornaments
than either of the other three. The southern half of
this façade is represented in the engraving. The ornaments
over the central doorway and at the corners
consist of the immense grotesque masks, with the
curved projecting tusks noticed on the Casa del
Gobernador; but the remaining surface is covered
with regular diamond lattice-work, while in connection
with each of the cornices is a line of stone blocks
with rounded faces, resembling short columns. Over
this lattice-work, but not entirely concealing it, are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
six peculiar and graceful ornaments, placed at regular
intervals, four of them surmounting doorways.
One of these, precisely like all the rest, is shown on
an enlarged scale in the engraving. It consists of
eight parallel horizontal bars, increasing in length as
they approach the upper cornice, and each terminating
at either end in a serpent's or monster's head with
open jaws. A human face with a peculiar head-dress,
large ear-pendants, and tongue hanging from the
mouth, looks down from the centre of the upper bars.
This face is fancied by Waldeck to represent the sun,
and something in its surroundings strikes Charnay as
partaking of the Egyptian style; hence the names
that have been applied to this façade. M. Viollet-le-Duc
attempts to prove the development of the architectural
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
ideas embodied in the Maya edifices from an
original structure of wood. His use of this claimed
peculiarity will be more appropriately spoken of hereafter,
but his illustration of the idea in connection
with this eastern front, is certainly striking as shown
in the annexed cut.<a id="FNanchor_V-42" href="#Footnote_V-42" class="fnanchor">[V-42]</a> The southern end of this building
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
is shown in one of Charnay's photographs, and,
together with a small portion of the western front, in
a drawing by Catherwood. These views show that
the ends, and probably all of the rear, are made up
of plain wall and lattice-work, with elaborate ornaments
at each of the corners.<a id="FNanchor_V-43" href="#Footnote_V-43" class="fnanchor">[V-43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I now pass on to the opposite, or western building,
known as the Serpent Temple, whose court façade is
shown in the engraving. At the time of the visits
of Catherwood and Charnay a large portion of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
front had fallen, and the standing portions only were
represented in their drawings and photographs, no
attempt being made in the former at restoration. In
1835, however, according to the testimony of both M.
Waldeck and Sr Peon, proprietor of Uxmal, it was
standing nearly intact; I have consequently preferred
to reproduce Waldeck's drawing of a portion of this
façade, especially as the portions shown by Catherwood
and Charnay agree almost exactly with this
drawing and prove its accuracy. But slight justice
can be done to this, the most magnificent and beautiful
front in America, by an engraving on so small
a scale as I am obliged to employ. Two serpents,
each with a monster's head between the open jaws
of which a human face appears, and the tail of a
rattlesnake placed near and above the head at either
end of the building, almost entirely surround the front
above the lower cornice, dividing the surface by the
folds and interlacing of their bodies into square panels.
That is, it seems to have been the aim of the builders
to form these panels by the folds of these two mighty
serpents, and the work is so described by all visitors,
but it appears from an examination of the folds, as
shown in the engraving, that the serpent whose head
and tail are shown on the right only encloses really
the first panel, and that each other panel is surrounded
by the endless body of a serpent without head or tail.
The scales or feathers on the serpent's body are somewhat
more clearly defined than is indicated in the engraving,
as is proved by Charnay's photograph. The
surface of this wall is filled with grecques and lattice-work
similar to those of the Governor's House, but
much more complicated; and each panel has one or
more human faces among its decorations, while several
of them have full-sized standing human figures.
Over each doorway and on the rounded corners of the
building, are the usual grotesque decorations, bearing
some likeness to three distorted faces or masks placed
one above another, and all furnished with the projecting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
curves, or hooks, previously compared to elephants'
trunks.<a id="FNanchor_V-44" href="#Footnote_V-44" class="fnanchor">[V-44]</a> Respecting the ends and rear of this building
nothing whatever has been recorded.</p>

<p>The northern building, standing on a terrace twenty
feet above the platform which supports the other structures,
and consequently overlooking them all, was very
probably intended by the builders as the crowning
feature of the Casa de Monjas. Its court façade was
crowded with sculptured designs, grander, perhaps,
and more imposing, but at the same time much less
elegant and refined than those of the fronts already
described. Apparently from no other motive than to
obtain more space on which to exercise their talent for
decorative art, and thus to render this front more
striking, the builders extended the front wall at regular
intervals above the upper cornice, forming thirteen
turrets seventeen feet high and ten feet wide,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
placed generally above the doorways. These turrets,
towering about eighty feet above the site of the city,
and loaded with elaborate sculpture, must have been
a prominent feature of the aboriginal Uxmal. Only
four of the turrets remained standing at the time of
Stephens' visit, and the wall was otherwise much
dilapidated. The only view is that given in Charnay's
photographs, none of the turrets being complete at
the time of his visit. The background of the sculpture
is divided into panels filled with grecques and
ornamented lattice-work very similar to that of the
Serpent front. Half the doorways are surmounted by
niches like those in the southern façade; while over
the alternate doorways and on all the corners are seen
the immense mask ornaments with the elephant-trunk
projection.<a id="FNanchor_V-45" href="#Footnote_V-45" class="fnanchor">[V-45]</a> A peculiarity of this building not noticed
by any authority, but clearly shown in Charnay's photograph,
is that not only are the corners rounded as
in the other buildings, but the walls at the corners are
not perpendicular either above or below the cornice,
inclining inward toward the top at an angle of about
seven degrees. Several human figures are noted
among the decorations, of ruder execution than others
at Uxmal, two of which seem to be playing on musical
instruments resembling somewhat a guitar and
harp; while a third is sitting with his hands crossed
on his breast, and bound by cords.<a id="FNanchor_V-46" href="#Footnote_V-46" class="fnanchor">[V-46]</a> All that is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
known of the exterior front of this northern building
is that among its decorations, which are comparatively
plain and simple, are two naked male figures, the condition
of whose genital organs indicates the existence
of the same phallic rites of which traces have been
already noted. With the additional remark that
traces of bright-colored paint are still visible in sheltered
portions of the sculptured façades, I conclude
my description of the so-called Nunnery.<a id="FNanchor_V-47" href="#Footnote_V-47" class="fnanchor">[V-47]</a></p>

<p>Immediately eastward of the Casa de Monjas are
several ruined structures shown in the plan, standing
on terraces somewhat lower than those last mentioned.
Only one of these, and which one of the four
or five shown on the plan is not stated, has been more
than mentioned by any visitor. This one exception
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
is the House of Birds. A portion of its front is
shown in the preceding cut, which sufficiently explains
the origin of the appellation. The interior is remarkable
for containing two rooms which are larger than
any others at Uxmal, measuring fourteen by fifty-two
feet, and about twenty feet in height. One of these
apartments has well-preserved traces of the paint
which formerly covered walls and ceiling; and the
other has an arch which differs somewhat from all
others in this ancient city. Its peculiarity is that the
overlapping blocks of stone, instead of lying horizontally
as in other cases, are slightly inclined, as is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
shown in the cut, forming a nearer approach to the
principle of the true arch with a key-stone than has
been found elsewhere in Yucatan. It will also be
noticed in the cut that the blocks, instead of being all
in regular cubical form, are some of them cut elbow-shaped.
This is a feature, which, if it exists in other
buildings, has not been particularly noticed.<a id="FNanchor_V-48" href="#Footnote_V-48" class="fnanchor">[V-48]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;CASA DEL ADIVINO.</p>

<p>Still further eastward are the pyramid and building
at D, on the plan, which have been called the Casa
del Adivino, or Prophet's House; the Casa del Enano,
or Dwarf's House; Tolokh-eis, or Holy Mountain,
and Kingsborough's Pyramid; the first three names
originating from traditions among the natives respecting
the former occupants of the buildings: the latter
having been applied by M. Waldeck in honor of the
Irish lord who aided in his explorations. Connecting
the Casa del Adivino with the Nunnery are lines of
low mounds, or terraces, possibly occupied in former
times by buildings, forming a courtyard which measures
eighty-five by one hundred and thirty-five feet,
and in the centre of which, at <i>z</i>, is the usual rude
column, or picote.</p>

<p>The supporting mound, or pyramid, in this case,
from a base of one hundred and fifty-five by two
hundred and thirty-five feet, rounded at the corners
so as to form an oval rather than a rectangular figure,<a id="FNanchor_V-49" href="#Footnote_V-49" class="fnanchor">[V-49]</a>
rises with very steep sides to a height of eighty-eight
feet, forming at the summit a platform twenty-two
by eighty-two feet. The surface of this pyramid
is faced with blocks of hewn stone laid in mortar.
The interior is presumably of rough stones in mortar,
although little or nothing is said on this point.<a id="FNanchor_V-50" href="#Footnote_V-50" class="fnanchor">[V-50]</a> Excavations
prove that the structure is solid without interior
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
galleries. The surface blocks are cubical, about
two feet in dimensions at the base, if we may trust
M. Waldeck's drawing, but diminishing toward the
top. They are not laid so as to break joints, yet so
solid is the structure that the powerful leverage of
growing roots has caused comparatively little damage.
The eastern front is shown on the following page. A
stairway one hundred and two feet on the slope, seventy
feet wide at the base, but narrowing toward the
summit, composed of ninety steps, each step being
about a foot high and five or six inches wide, leads
up this side. The slope of this stairway is so steep,
being inclined at an angle of about eighty degrees,
that visitors have found it very difficult to ascend and
descend. Padre Cogolludo was the first to complain
of the steep grade. He says: 'I once did go up that
of Uxumual, and when I would come down, I did repent
me; because so narrow are the steps, and so
many in number, that the edifice goes up exceeding
straight, and being of no small height, the head
swims, and there is even some peril in its descent.'<a id="FNanchor_V-51" href="#Footnote_V-51" class="fnanchor">[V-51]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i194"></a>
<img src="images/i194.jpg" width="550" height="316" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Casa del Adivino at Uxmal.</p>
</div>

<p>In the centre of the western slope of the Prophets
Pyramid, toward the Nunnery, are certain structures,
which M. Waldeck represents as projecting portions
of the pyramid, or piers, the lower one forming a
platform fifteen by forty feet, sixty feet up the slope;
and the upper rising from this platform and forming a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
second, twenty by twenty-five feet, continuous with
the main summit platform of the pyramid. The upper
projection, or pier, has since proved to be a distinct
building, with richly sculptured front,<a id="FNanchor_V-52" href="#Footnote_V-52" class="fnanchor">[V-52]</a> one
central door, and two plain rooms in the interior; the
outer one seven by fifteen feet, and nineteen feet high;
the inner, four by twelve feet, and eleven feet high.
The lower pier may have been a similar structure, but
it is completely in ruins below the central platform,
except a few slight traces of rooms near the base.
Mr Stephens is disposed to believe that a broad staircase
of peculiar construction, supported by a triangular
arch-like stairways that will be mentioned later
in a few instances in connection with other Yucatan
ruins&mdash;originally led up to the front of the building
on the slope; otherwise it is difficult to imagine by
what means these apartments could have been reached.
The stones of these projecting portions are longer than
elsewhere, and laid so as to break joints. On the summit
platform stands a small building, twelve feet wide,
seventy-two feet long, and about sixteen feet high,
leaving a promenade five feet wide at its base. This
building presents no feature with which the reader is
not already perfectly familiar, except that it contains
only one range of rooms, having no dividing interior
wall. The interior is divided into three rooms, which
do not communicate with each other, and are not
plastered. The central room is seven by twenty-four
feet, and its door is on the west, just opposite the
platform formed by the projecting pier. The end
rooms are seven by nineteen feet, and open on the
promenade at either side of the eastern stairway.<a id="FNanchor_V-53" href="#Footnote_V-53" class="fnanchor">[V-53]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>Cut on the interior walls of the end rooms, seventy-two
circular figures, two or three inches in diameter,
have been observed. M. Waldeck, as usual, has a
theory respecting these circles, or rather he has two
in case one should prove unsatisfactory. He thinks
they may have been made by prisoners to kill time,
or they may have been a record of sacrifices consummated
in this cu. The sculptured decorations
of the exterior walls are described as elegant but
simple. We have here the back-ground of ornamental
lattice-work, and besides this the prominent feature is
four full-length human figures standing on the west
front, two on each side of the doorway, and overlooking
the courtyard of the Casa de Monjas. They are
the figures of males, and are naked, except a sort of
helmet on the head, a scarf round the shoulders, and
a belt round the waist. The arms are crossed high
on the breast, and each hand holds something resembling
a hammer. The genital organs are represented
in their proper proportions, and were evidently intended
by the sculptor as the prominent feature of
the statues. All four had fallen from their places,
even at the time of M. Waldeck's visit, but this explorer
by careful search collected sufficient fragments
of the four, which are precisely alike, to reconstruct
one. He intended to bring these fragments away
with him, but his intentions being thwarted by the
emissaries of the Mexican government, he buried the
statue in a locality only known to himself.<a id="FNanchor_V-54a" href="#Footnote_V-54a" class="fnanchor">[V-54]</a> It remains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
to be stated that the decorations of this Prophet's
House, like that of the Nunnery, were originally
painted in bright colors. Blue, red, yellow, and white,
were found by M. Waldeck on the least exposed portions.
There can be but little doubt that this pyramid
was a temple where the sacrifices described in a
preceding volume were celebrated. It has been customary
with many writers to speak of it, as of all similar
structures in America, as a Teocalli, the name of
such temples in Anáhuac; but thus to apply an Aztec
name to monuments in regions inhabited by people
whose relation to the Aztecs or their ancestors is yet
far from proved, is at least injudicious, since it tends
to cause confusion when we come to consider the subject
of aboriginal history.<a id="FNanchor_V-55a" href="#Footnote_V-55a" class="fnanchor">[V-55]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">UXMAL&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS RELICS.</p>

<p>All the principal structures of Uxmal have now
been fully described, and as all conclusions and general
remarks respecting this city will be deferred until I
can include in such remarks all the ruins of the state,
I take leave of Uxmal with a mention of a very few
miscellaneous relics spoken of by different travelers.</p>

<p>No water has been found in the immediate vicinity
of the city, the dependence having probably been on
artificial reservoirs and <i>aguadas</i>, possibly also on subterranean
springs, or <i>senotes</i>, whose locality is not
known. There are several of these aguadas within a
radius of a few miles of Uxmal. They resemble, in
their present abandoned condition, small natural ponds,
and their stagnant waters are thought to have much to
do with the unhealthiness of the locality. They have
no appearance of being artificial, but the inhabitants
universally believe them to be so, and Mr Stephens,
from his observations in other parts of the country, is inclined
to agree with the general belief. I have already
noticed the dome-shaped underground apartments
which occur frequently among the ruins, and were
probably used as cisterns, or reservoirs, for the storing
up of water for the use of the city. Mr Norman
states also that one of the numerous mounds, that
occur in all directions, westward of the Nunnery, "is
found to be an immense reservoir or cistern, having a
double curb; the interior of which was beautifully
finished with stucco, and in good preservation." He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
further states that some of these mounds have been
opened and "seemed to have been intended originally
for sepulchres," although Mr Stephens could find no
traces of sepulchral relics.</p>

<p>M. Waldeck barely mentions the discovery of small
fragments of flint artificially shaped, but beyond this
there is no record of relics in the shape of implements.
Traces of pottery are nearly as rare. Mr
Norman says he found fragments of broken vases on
the pyramid E of the plan; and Mr Stephens found
similar fragments in one of the reservoirs on the platform
of the Governor's House, together with a nearly
complete tripod vase, one foot in diameter, with enameled
surface.</p>

<p>Mr Friederichsthal found on a low mound five stones
lying, as he states, from north-west to south-west (<i>?</i>),
the middle one of which was over twelve feet long
and covered with carved figures.</p>

<p>A native reported to Sr Zavala that he had seen a
stone table, painted red, located in a cellar, and indicating
a place of sacrifice. This report would not be
worth recording were it not for the fact that similar
tables are of frequent occurrence in Chiapas, as will
be seen in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The Abbé Domenech has something to say of Uxmal
antiquities; he says that "carved figures representing
Boudha of Java, seated on a Siva's head,
were found at Uxmal, in Yucatan."<a id="FNanchor_V-54" href="#Footnote_V-54" class="fnanchor">[V-54]</a></p>

<p>One and a half hour's ride westward from Uxmal a
mound surmounted with ruins, called Senuisacal, was
seen at a distance; and about the same distance north-westward,
not far from Muna, was found one of the
typical buildings on a mound. This building was
nearly entire, except that the outer walls above the
cornice had fallen. Between this place and Uxmal,
about five miles from the latter, is a mound with two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
buildings, to which the same description will apply.
These ruins were seen by Mr Stephens during a hasty
trip from Uxmal, unaccompanied by his artist companion.
Ruins observed still further westward will
be included in another group.<a id="FNanchor_V-55" href="#Footnote_V-55" class="fnanchor">[V-55]</a></p>

<p>In describing the ruins outside of Uxmal which
compose the central group, and which may for the
most part be passed over rapidly from their similarity
to each other and to those already described, I shall
locate each by bearing and distance as accurately as
possible, and all the principal localities are also laid
down on the map. This matter of location is not,
however, very important. The whole central region
is strewn with mounds bearing ruined buildings; some
of these have received particular attention from the
natives and from travelers, and have consequently
been named. I shall describe them by the names that
have been so applied, but it must be noted that very
few of these names are in any way connected with the
aboriginal cities; they were mostly applied at first to
particular structures, and later to the ruins in their
immediate vicinity; consequently several of the small
groups which have been honored with distinct names,
may, in many instances, have formed a part of the
same city.</p>

<p>At Sacbé,&mdash;meaning a 'paved road of white stone,'
a name derived from such a paved way in the vicinity,
which will be mentioned later,&mdash;four or five miles
south-east of Uxmal, besides other 'old walls' is a
group of three buildings. One of them is twelve and
a half by fifty-three feet; none, however, present
any peculiar feature, save that in one of the doorways
two columns appear.<a id="FNanchor_V-56" href="#Footnote_V-56" class="fnanchor">[V-56]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SKULLS AND CROSSBONES AT NOHPAT.</p>

<p>Somewhat less than ten miles eastward of Uxmal
is the town of Nohcacab, 'the great place of good
land,' preserving the name of an aboriginal town which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
formerly existed somewhere in this vicinity. In this
village are several mounds; and a sculptured head,
with specimens of pottery, has been dug up in the
plaza. The surrounding country within a radius of a
few miles abounds in ruins, two of which are particularly
mentioned. The first is known as Xcoch, and
consists of the pyramid shown in the cut. It is between
eighty and ninety feet high, plainly visible from
the Prophet's House at Uxmal, but the buildings on
its summit, like its sides, are almost completely in ruins,
although traces of steps yet remain. Great and marvelous
stories were told by the natives concerning a
senote, or well, in this vicinity; and it proved indeed to
be a most wonderful cavern with branching subterranean
galleries, worn by the feet of ancient carriers
of water; but it was entirely of natural formation, a
single block of sculptured stone, with the worn paths
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
being the only traces of man's presence. The second
of the ruins is that of Nohpat, 'great lord,' three
miles from Nohcacab toward Uxmal, whose buildings
are plainly visible from it, and of which it may, not
improbably, have been a continuation or dependency.
A mound, or pyramid, two hundred and fifty feet long
at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet high on the
slope, with a nearly perfect stairway on the southern
side, supports a portion of a dilapidated building,
which overlooks the numerous ruins scattered over the
plain at its foot. A single corridor, or room, is left
intact, and is only three feet and five inches wide.
At the foot of the stairway is a platform with a picote,
as at Uxmal, in its centre. There was also lying at
the foot of the steps, the flat stone
represented in the cut, measuring
eleven and one third feet in length
by three feet ten inches in width.
The human figure in low relief on
its surface is very rudely carved,
and was moreover much defaced by
the rains to which for many years it
had been exposed. Near the pyramid
another platform, two hundred
feet square, and raised about twenty
feet, supports buildings at right
angles with each other, one of which
has two stories built after a method
which will be made clear in describing
other ruins. The only others of
the many monuments of Nohpat
which throw any additional light on Yucatan antiquities,
are those found on a level spot, whose shape is
that of a right-angled triangle with a mound at each
angle. Here are many scattered blocks and fragments,
two of which united formed the statue shown in the cut
on the next page. It is four and a quarter feet high
and a foot and a half in diameter. The face seems to
be represented as looking sideways or backward over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
the shoulder, and is surmounted by a head-dress in
which the head of a wild beast may be made out,
recalling slightly the idols which we have already seen
in Nicaragua. Other statues might doubtless be reconstructed
by means of a thorough search, but only
the stone blocks shown in the cut are particularly
mentioned. They are twenty-seven inches high and
from sixteen to twenty-two inches wide, bearing alternately
sculptured on their fronts the skull and cross-bones,
symbols in later times&mdash;perhaps also when these
carvings were made&mdash;of death. In its original condition
Nohpat may not unlikely have been as grand a
city as Uxmal, but it is almost completely in ruins.<a id="FNanchor_V-57" href="#Footnote_V-57" class="fnanchor">[V-57]</a>

<p>In the same region, some five or six miles southward
from Nohcacab, and perhaps ten or twelve miles
south-eastward from Uxmal, is a most extensive group
of ruins, probably the remains of an ancient city,
known as Kabah. Sixteen different structures are
located in a space about two thousand by three thousand
feet, on Mr Stephens' plan, which, however, was
not formed by measurements, but by observation from
the top of a pyramid. Norman is the only visitor,
except Stephens and Catherwood, and his description
amounts to nothing. I proceed to describe such of
Kabah monuments as differ in construction and sculpture
from those we have previously examined, and
consequently throw additional light on Maya architecture.</p>

<p>A mound forms a summit platform, raised twenty
feet, and measuring one hundred and forty-two by two
hundred feet. Ascending the terrace from its south-western
side, buildings of the ordinary type appear
on the right and left; the former resting on the slope
instead of on the summit of the terrace,&mdash;that is,
the rear wall, of great thickness, rises perpendicularly
from the base. In the centre of the platform is an
enclosure seven feet high and twenty-seven feet square,
formed of hewn stones, the lower tier of which was
sculptured with a continuous line of hieroglyphics extending
round the circumference. No picote, however,
was found within the enclosure. Directly in front, or
on the north-east side of the platform, a stairway of
twenty steps, forty feet wide, leads up to a higher
terrace, the arrangement being much like that of the
northern building of the Casa de Monjas at Uxmal.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
But in this case the upper platform, instead of being
long and narrow as usual, is nearly square, and supports
a building of the same shape, whose front at the
top of the stairway measures one hundred and fifty-one
feet. The advanced state of ruin in which the
whole structure was found, made it difficult to form
an idea of its original plan, and Mr Stephens' description
in this case fails to present clearly the idea which
he formed on the subject. The front portion of the
edifice, however, which is the best preserved of all,
has two double ranges of apartments, separated by a
very thick wall, and all under the same roof. Two
peculiarities were noted in these rooms. The inner
rooms of the front range have their floors two feet
and eight inches higher than the outer, and are entered
from the latter by two stone steps; while in one
case at least these steps are cut from a single block of
stone, the lower step taking the form of a scroll, and
the walls at the sides are covered with carvings, as
shown in the cut. Over the rear wall of the front
range rises a structure of hewn stone four feet thick
and fifteen feet high, which, like the turrets over the
northern building of the Nunnery and the Casa de
Palomas at Uxmal, could only have been intended as
an ornament, but which from the ground beneath presents
every appearance of a second story. The exterior
sculpture of this front, except a small portion at
the northern end, has fallen, but enough remains to
indicate that the decorations were most rich and elaborate,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
though uniform; and, unlike those of any structure
yet met with, they covered the whole surface of
the front, both above and below the central cornice.
The cut shows the general appearance of these decorations.<a id="FNanchor_V-58" href="#Footnote_V-58" class="fnanchor">[V-58]</a>
This building is called by the natives <i>Xco&#8580;poop</i>,
or 'straw hat doubled up.'</p>

<p class="caption">Sculptured Front at Kabah.</p>
</div>

<p>At a short distance from the ruin just described,
in a north-easterly direction, is another group, the details
of whose arrangement, in the absence of a carefully
prepared plan, it is useless to attempt to describe,
but three new features presented by these ruins require
notice. First, one of them, from a base of one
hundred and six by one hundred and forty-seven feet,
is built in three receding stories. That is, the roof of
each story, or range, forms a platform, or promenade,
before the doors of the one above; or, in other words,
the stories are built one above another on the slope of
a pyramid. Second, an exterior staircase leads up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
from story to story. These staircases are supported
by half of one of the regular triangular arches resting
against the top of the wall of the buildings. The
accompanying cut, although not representing this or
any other particular building, is intended as a half
section to illustrate the construction of the Maya
structures in several stories, and that of the stairways

solid mound, or terrace; <i>bb</i>, the apartments or corridors;
<i>d</i>, the staircase; and <i>c</i>, an open passage under
the half arch of overlapping stones that supports the
stairway. In this Kabah building the stairway leading
to the foot of the third story is not immediately
over the lower one, but in another part of the edifice.
The third peculiarity is a double one, and is noticed
in some of the doorways; since here for the first time
we find lintels of stone, supported each by a central
column, about six feet high, of rude workmanship,
with square blocks serving as pedestal and capital.<a id="FNanchor_V-59" href="#Footnote_V-59" class="fnanchor">[V-59]</a></p>

<p>The solitary arch shown in the cut stands on a

top fallen. "Darkness rests upon its history, but in

Kabah is not without its pyramid, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
one hundred and eighty feet square at the base, and
eighty feet high, with traces of ruined apartments at
the foot. In one of the buildings the two principal
doorways are under the stairway which leads up to
the second story, and over one of them was a wooden
lintel ten feet long, composed of two beams and covered
with carving that seemed to represent a human
figure standing on a serpent. Mr Stephens carried
these carved beams, which were in almost a perfect
state of preservation, to New York, where they were
burned. He considered them the most important relics
in the country, although his drawing does not indicate
them to be anything very remarkable, except as
bearing a clearly cut and complicated carving, executed
on exceedingly hard wood without implements of iron
or steel. The building with the sculptured lintel, and
another, stand on an immense terrace, measuring one
hundred by eight hundred feet. One of the apartments
has the red hand in bright colors imprinted in
many places on its walls. A stucco ornament, painted
in bright colors, much dilapidated, but apparently
having represented two large birds facing each other,
was found in a room of another building. In still
another edifice, a room is described as constructed on
a new and curious plan, having "a raised platform
about four feet high, and in each of the inner corners
was a rounded vacant place, about large enough for a
man to stand in." Another new feature was a doorway&mdash;the
only one in the building to which it belonged&mdash;with
sculptured stone jambs, each five feet
eleven inches high, two feet three inches wide, and
composed of two blocks one above the other. The
sculptured designs are similar one to the other, each
consisting of a standing and kneeling figure over a line
of hieroglyphics. One of these decorated jambs is
shown in the cut given on the following page. The
weapon in the hands of the kneeling figure corresponds
almost exactly with the flint-edged swords
used by the natives of the country at the time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
conquest. This group of ruins, representing an aboriginal
city probably larger and more magnificent even
than Uxmal, was discovered by the workmen who
made the road, or camino real, on which the ruins
stand; but so little interest did the discovery excite
in the minds of travelers over the road, that the
knowledge of it did not reach Mérida.<a id="FNanchor_V-61" href="#Footnote_V-61" class="fnanchor">[V-61]</a>

<p>Southward and south-eastward of Kabah, all included
within a radius of eight or ten miles, are ruins
at Sanacté, Xampon, Chack, Sabacché, Zayi, and
Labná, the last two being extensive and important.
At Sanacté are two buildings, which stand
in a milpa, or cornfield. One has a high ornamental
wall on its top, and the front of another appears as
represented in the cut. It will be noticed that in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
this, as in most of the structures in this region, the
doorways have stone jambs, or posts, each of two
pieces, instead of being formed simply by the blocks
that compose the walls; the lintels are also generally
of stone. At Xampon are the remains of a building
that was built continuously round a rectangle eighty
by one hundred and five feet; it is mostly fallen. In
the immediate vicinity ruins of the ordinary type are
mentioned under the names of Hiokowitz, Kuepak,
and Zekilna. At Chack a two-storied building stands
on a terrace, which is itself built on the summit of a
natural stony hill. A very remarkable feature at
Chack is the natural senote which supplies water to
the modern as it did undoubtedly to the ancient inhabitants.
It is a narrow passage, or succession of
passages and small caverns, penetrating the earth for
over fifteen hundred feet, much of the distance the
descent being nearly vertical. At Sabacché is a
building of a single apartment, whose front presents
the peculiarity of four cornices, dividing the surface
into four nearly equal portions, the lower cornice being
as usual at the height of the top of the doorway. The
first space above the doorway is plain, like that below;
but the two upper spaces are divided by pilasters into
panels, which are filled with diamond lattice-work.
Three other buildings were visited, and one of them
sketched by Catherwood, but they present no new
features except that the red hand, common here as
elsewhere, is larger than usual.<a id="FNanchor_V-63" href="#Footnote_V-63" class="fnanchor">[V-63]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Casa Grande at Zayi.</p>
</div>

<p>At Zayi, situated in the midst of a beautiful landscape
of rolling hills, the principal edifice, called the
Casa Grande, is built in three receding stories, as
already explained, extending round the four sides of
the supporting mound, which rests on a slight natural
elevation. The lower story is one hundred and twenty
by two hundred and sixty-five feet; the second, sixty
by two hundred and twenty feet; and the third, standing
on the summit of the mound, is eighteen by one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
hundred and fifty feet. The cut shows the ground
plan of the Casa Grande, much of which is fallen. A
stairway thirty-two feet wide leads up to the third
story on the front, and a narrower stairway to the
second platform on the rear. Ten of the northern
rooms in the second story are completely filled with
stone and mortar, which for some unimaginable reason
must have been put in while the structure was being
built. This part of the building is known among
the natives as the Casa Cerrada, or closed house.
It will be noticed from the plan that the front and
rear platforms are not exactly of the same width.
With respect to the exterior walls, those of the lower
range are nearly all fallen. The western portion of
the front of the second range is shown in the cut on
the following page. Ranges of pillars, or pilasters,
compose the bulk of the ornamentation, both above
and below the cornice. A strange if not very artistic
and delicate decoration found elsewhere on this building,
is the figure of a man standing on his hands with
his legs spread apart. The lintels are of stone, and
many of the doorways are of triple width, in which
cases the lintel is supported by two rudely-formed
columns, about six and a half-feet high, with square
capitals, as shown in the following cut. The front
of the third range appears to have been entirely
plain. In another building near by "a high projection
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
running along the wall" in the interior of an
apartment is mentioned. Some five hundred yards
directly south of the Casa Grande is a low, small,
flat-roofed building, with a wide archway extending
completely through it. It is much dilapidated, and
hardly noticeable in itself, but from the centre of its
flat roof rises the extraordinary structure shown in
the cut, which is a perpendicular wall, two feet thick
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and thirty feet high, pierced with ranges of openings,
or windows, which give it, as the discoverer remarks,
the appearance of a New England factory. The stone
of which it is constructed is rough, and it was originally
covered with ornaments in stucco, a few of
which still remain on the rear. The only other Zayi
monument mentioned is an immense terrace about fifteen
hundred feet square. Most of its surface was
not explored, but one building was noticed and
sketched in which the floor of the inner range of
rooms is raised two feet and a half above that of the
front range, being reached by steps, as was the case
in the building at Kabah, already described. The interior
wall was also decorated with a row of pilasters.
The superstitious natives, like those I have spoken of
at Utatlan in Guatemala, hear mysterious music every
Good Friday, proceeding from among the ruins.<a id="FNanchor_V-64" href="#Footnote_V-64" class="fnanchor">[V-64]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF LABNÁ.</p>

<p>The ruins of Labná comprise some buildings equal
in extent and magnificence to any in Yucatan, but all
far gone in decay. In one case a mound forty-five
feet in height supports a building twenty by forty-three
feet, of the ordinary type, except that its southern
front is a perpendicular wall, thirty feet high
above the cornice over the doorways. This front has
no openings like other similar walls already noticed,
but was originally covered throughout its whole surface
with colossal ornaments in stucco, of which but a
few small fragments remained, the whole structure
being, when examined, on the point of falling. Among
the figures of which sufficient portions remain to identify
their original form, are: a row of death's heads,
two lines of human figures in high relief, an immense
seated human figure, a ball, or globe, supported by a
man kneeling on one knee and by another standing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
at its side. All the figures were painted in bright
colors still visible, and the whole structure appeared
to its only visitors "the most curious and extraordinary"
seen in the country. Another building, surrounding
a courtyard, which was entered through a
gateway, differed in its plan from those seen elsewhere,
but the plan unfortunately is not given. Over
each of the interior, or court, doorways, on one side
at least, is a niche occupied by a painted stucco ornament
supposed to represent the sun. Near by, a terrace
four hundred feet long and one hundred and fifty
feet wide supports a building of two receding stories
with a front of two hundred and eighty-two feet.
The upper story consists of a single line of apartments
and its walls are perfectly plain. The lower
story has a double line of rooms, and its front is elaborately
sculptured, the chief peculiarity in this front
being that it presents three distinct styles in as many
portions of the wall. The opposite cut shows a corner
of this wall in which the open mouth of an alligator
or monster, from which looks out a human face, is a
new and remarkable feature in Maya decoration. On
the roof of the lower range is a narrow opening which
leads vertically to a chamber like those found so frequently
at Uxmal, except that this, instead of being
dome-shaped, is like the ordinary rooms, with triangular-arched
ceiling, being seven by eleven feet and ten
feet high. Both sides and bottom are covered with
cement, and there is nothing but its position in the
mass of masonry, between the arches and over the
interior apartments, to indicate that it was not originally
used as a cistern for storing water. There is
also in connection with the ruins of Labná an entrance
to what may well be supposed to have been a subterranean
senote like those noticed at Xcoch and Chack,
but it could not be explored. It was noted that the
natives about Labná, had much less superstitious fear
respecting the spirits of the antiguos haunting the
ruins than those of most other localities, although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
even they had no desire to explore the various apartments.</p>

<p class="caption">Corner at Labná.</p>
</div>

<p>At Tabi, a few leagues distant, is a heap of ruins,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
from which material had been taken for the construction
of a modern church, and many sculptured fragments
had been inserted in the walls of the hacienda
buildings. A stream of water was pouring from the
open mouth of a stone idol, possibly worshiped by the
ancient inhabitants; "to such base uses," etc. A cave
near by was the subject of much marvelous report,
but its exploration led to nothing in an antiquarian
point of view.<a id="FNanchor_V-65" href="#Footnote_V-65" class="fnanchor">[V-65]</a></p>

<p>At Kewick, seven or eight miles southward of
Labná, a large space is strewn with the remains of a
ruined city, the casa real itself being built on the terrace
of an ancient mound. One single stone, however,
among these ruins demands the attention of the
reader, familiar as he now is with the general features
of ancient Maya art. This stone is one of those
which compose the top layer, joining the sides of the
ceiling in one of the apartments. Singled out for
some inexplicable reason from its fellows, it bore a
painting in bright colors, chiefly red and green, representing
a grotesquely adorned human form surrounded
by a line of hieroglyphics. The painting measured
eighteen by thirty inches and was taken out from its
place by Mr Stephens for the purpose of removal, but
proved too heavy for that purpose. Two fronts were
sketched by Mr Catherwood at Kewick; one had a
line of pillars separated by diamond-shaped ornaments
on each side of the doorway; the other was decorated
also with a line of pillars, or pilasters, standing close
together, as on the Casa de Tortugas at Uxmal.<a id="FNanchor_V-66" href="#Footnote_V-66" class="fnanchor">[V-66]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">XUL, SACACAL, AND CHACCHOB.</p>

<p>Xul, a modern village near by, stands also on the
site of an aboriginal town, and the cura's residence is
built of material from an ancient mound, many sculptured
stones occupying prominent places in the walls;
the church moreover contains sixteen columns from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the neighboring ruins of Nohcacab. Two leagues
from Xul where some ruins were seen, two apartments
had red paintings on the plastered walls and
ceilings. A row of legs, suggesting a procession,
heads decorated with plumes, and human figures
standing on their hands, all well-drawn and natural to
the life, were still visible, and interesting even in their
mutilated state. The rancho buildings at Nohcacab&mdash;a
second place of the same name as the one already
mentioned towards Uxmal&mdash;are also decorated with
relics from the 'old walls,' but nothing of interest was
seen in connection with the ruins themselves, except
one room in which the ceiling formed an acute angle
at the top instead of being united by a layer of horizontal
stones as in other places.<a id="FNanchor_V-67" href="#Footnote_V-67" class="fnanchor">[V-67]</a></p>

<p>Some leagues further eastward, in the neighborhood
of the town of Tekax, ruins are mentioned at
Sacacal, Ticum, Santa María, and Chacchob. At Sacacal
is a chamber with an opening at the top, as at
Labná, only much larger; and this one has also three
recesses, about two feet deep, in the sides. An apartment
here has a painted stone in the top layer as at
Kewick; and one building has its wall rounded instead
of straight, although this is only on the exterior, the
inner surface being straight as usual. The remains at
Ticum were only reported to exist by the Cura of San
José. At Santa María a high mound only was seen.<a id="FNanchor_V-68" href="#Footnote_V-68" class="fnanchor">[V-68]</a>
At Chacchob ruins of the usual type are represented,
by a Spanish writer in a Yucatan magazine, to be enclosed
within a wall, straight from north to south, the
rest of the circumference of over six thousand feet
being semi-circular. The only entrance is in the centre
of the straight side. A well occupies the centre
of the enclosure, the chief pyramid is on the summit
of a natural elevation, and in one room a door was
noticed which was much wider at the top than at the
bottom. On the edge of a wall eight hundred varas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
distant, grooves worn by the ropes formerly used in
drawing water are still to be seen.<a id="FNanchor_V-69" href="#Footnote_V-69" class="fnanchor">[V-69]</a></p>

<p>Further north, in the north-eastern corner of the
rectangle which contains our central group of ruins,
are Akil and Mani, the relics of the former locality,
so far as known, being chiefly built into the walls
of modern buildings. Mani was a prominent city at
the time of the conquest, and the modern village
stands on the remains of the aboriginal town, mounds
and other relics not described being yet visible. Mr
Stephens here found some documents, dating back to
the coming of the Spaniards, which are of great importance
in connection with the question of the antiquity
of the Yucatan ruins, and will be noticed when
I come to speak of that point. The only monuments
of the central group remaining to be mentioned are
those of Chunhuhu, in the extreme south-western corner
of the rectangle. These are very extensive, evidently
the remains of a large city, and several of the buildings
were sketched by Mr Catherwood, being of one
story, and having grotesque human figures as a prominent
feature in their exterior decoration. One is
plastered on the outside, as Mr Stephens thinks all
the Yucatan buildings may have been originally&mdash;that
is, on the plain portions of their walls. One front has
the frequently noticed line of close-standing pilasters,
with full-length human figures at intervals, which
stand with uplifted hands, as if supporting the weight
of the upper cornice.<a id="FNanchor_V-70" href="#Footnote_V-70" class="fnanchor">[V-70]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
a city which was famous in the ancient traditionary
annals of the Mayas, whose structures served both
natives and Spaniards as fortifications at the time of
the conquest, and whose ruins have been more or less
known to the inhabitants of the country since that
epoch. The ruins lie twenty miles west of Valladolid,
the chief town of the eastern portion of the state, on
a public road in plain view of all travelers by that
route. In this case the original Maya name has been
retained, Chichen meaning 'mouth of wells,' and
Itza being the name of a branch of the Maya people,
or of a royal family, which played a most prominent
part in Yucatan history. The name Chichen comes
probably from two great senotes which supplied the
ancient city with water, and which differ from the
complicated underground passages noted in other parts
of the state, being immense natural pits of great depth,
with nearly perpendicular sides, the only traces of
artificial improvement being in the winding steps that
lead down to the water's surface, and slight remains
of a wall about the edge of the precipice. So far as
explored, the remains may be included in a rectangle
measuring two thousand by three thousand feet, and
their arrangement is shown in the plan on the next
page, made by Mr Catherwood.<a id="FNanchor_V-72" href="#Footnote_V-72" class="fnanchor">[V-72]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHICHEN&mdash;NUNNERY.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable of the Chichen edifices
is that known as the Nunnery, marked H on the
plan.<a id="FNanchor_V-73" href="#Footnote_V-73" class="fnanchor">[V-73]</a> Of course in this and other buildings I shall
confine my description chiefly to points of contrast
with ruins already mentioned, and well known to the
reader. Supporting the Nunnery, instead of a pyramid,
we have for the first time a solid mass of masonry
one hundred and twelve by one hundred and sixty feet
rising with perpendicular sides to a height of about
thirty-two feet. On the summit, with a base one
hundred and four feet long, is a building in two receding
stories, of which the upper, whose summit was
sixty-five feet above the ground, is almost entirely in
ruins. The first story is better preserved, and its
front was decorated with sculpture of which no drawings
have been made. In the centre of the northern
side a stairway fifty-six feet wide leads up, with
thirty-nine steps, to the top of the solid basement,
which forms a broad promenade round the superimposed
building, and continues with fifteen additional
steps to the roof of the first story. One room in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
first story is forty-seven feet long; several contain
niches in their walls, extending from floor to ceiling
and bearing traces of having been covered with
painted figures, some of them human with plumed
heads; and some of the apparent doorways are false,
or walled up, evidently from the date of their first
construction. Attached to the eastern end of the
solid structure is a projecting wing, shown in the plan,
sixty feet long, thirty-five feet wide, and twenty-five
feet high, consisting of only a single story, and divided
into nine apartments, several of which are filled
up with solid masonry. The lintels throughout the
Nunnery are of stone, and the interior walls of the rooms
are plastered. The exterior walls of this eastern wing
are covered with rich sculpture, both above and below
the cornice, but this sculpture presents no contrasts
with that of Uxmal, or other cities, sufficiently
striking to be verbally described. Only a few feet
from the eastern end of the Nunnery, and indeed described
by Charnay as wings of that edifice, are the
two small buildings <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of the plan. The former
is thirteen by thirty-eight feet, and twenty feet high;
the latter, sometimes known as the Iglesia, or Church,
is fourteen by twenty-six feet, and thirty-one feet
high, containing only one room. These structures
present a most imposing appearance by reason of their
great height in proportion to their ground dimensions.<a id="FNanchor_V-74" href="#Footnote_V-74" class="fnanchor">[V-74]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHICHEN&mdash;AKAB-TZIB.</p>

<p>The building G of the plan, instead of standing on
an artificial mound, rests on the level plain, but the
usual effect is produced by excavating the surface
about it, thus giving it the appearance of resting on
a raised foundation. It measures forty-eight by one
hundred and forty-nine feet, and its outer walls are
perfectly plain. The roof is reached by a stairway
forty-five feet wide in the centre of the eastern front,
while, corresponding with the stairway, on the western
front is a solid projection thirty-four by forty-four feet,
of unknown use. The floor of the inner range of
rooms is one foot higher than that of the outer, and
on the under surface of a lintel in one of the interior
doorways is the sculptured design shown in the cut
on the following page, surrounded by a row of hieroglyphics,
of which only a small portion are included
in the cut, but which are of the same type as those
we have seen at Copan. The subject seems to be
some mysterious incantation or other sacrificial rite,
and the hieroglyphics, known as the 'writing in the
dark,' in Maya <i>akab-tzib</i>, have given their name to
the building.<a id="FNanchor_V-75" href="#Footnote_V-75" class="fnanchor">[V-75]</a></p>

feet wide, having solid balustrades which terminate
at the bottom in two immense serpent's heads
ten feet long, with open mouths and protruding tongues
as in the opposite cut. On the platform stands a building
forty-three by forty-nine feet, and about twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
feet high, having only a single doorway in the centre
of each front. These doorways have all wooden lintels
elaborately carved, and the jambs,&mdash;probably of
stone, although Norman says they are of wood&mdash;are
also covered with sculpture. The upper portion of
one of these sculptured jambs is represented in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
cut, and the designs on the others are of a similar
general character. The northern doorway, which
seems to have been the principal entrance, is twenty
feet wide and its lintel is supported by two columns,
each eight feet and eight inches high, with projecting
bases, and having their entire surface decorated, like
the jambs at the sides, with sculptured figures. The
interior plan of this building differs materially from
any we have met; since the doorways on the east,
west, and south open into a corridor six feet wide,
which extends without partition walls round the three
corresponding sides of the edifice; while the northern
doorway gives access also to a corridor forty feet long
and six and a third feet wide. Through the centre of
the rear wall of this corridor a doorway leads into a
room twelve feet nine inches by nineteen feet eight
inches, and seventeen feet high. This room also differs
widely from any before described, for its ceiling,
instead of being formed by a single triangular arch
running lengthways, has two transverse arches supported
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
by immense carved zapote-beams stretched
across the room, and which rest, each at its centre, on
two square pillars whose dimensions are twenty-two
inches on each side and nine feet in height. The cut
shows the ground plan of this remarkable structure,
the squares at <i>a</i> representing the feet of the interior
pillars, and the circles at <i>b</i>, the pillars that support
the lintel of the northern doorway.<a id="FNanchor_V-76" href="#Footnote_V-76" class="fnanchor">[V-76]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHICHEN&mdash;THE GYMNASIUM.</p>

<p>The building at A of the plan is called by the natives
the Iglesia, by Norman the Temple, by Charnay
the Cirque, and by Stephens the Gymnasium. The
latter names were applied from the supposition that
the structure served for a peculiar game of ball to
which the Aztec kings, at least, if not the Mayas,
were much addicted. Landa seems, however, entitled
to the honor of having invented this theory, since he
speaks of buildings in this part of Chichen devoted to
amusements.<a id="FNanchor_V-77" href="#Footnote_V-77" class="fnanchor">[V-77]</a> This structure is very similar to the
one marked H on the plan of Uxmal. It consists
of two parallel walls, thirty by two hundred and
seventy-four feet, twenty-six feet high, and one hundred
and twenty feet apart. The inner walls facing
each other present a plain undecorated surface, but in
the centre of each, about twenty feet from the ground,
is fixed by means of a tenon, a stone ring four feet in
diameter and thirteen inches thick, with a hole nineteen
inches in diameter through the centre, surrounded
by two sculptured serpents intertwined as in the following
cut. M. Charnay found only one of these
rings in place at the time of his visit. The south end
of the eastern wall served as a base to superimposed
buildings or ranges of apartments erected on it after
the manner of all the Yucatan structures of more
than one story. The upper range has a part of its
exterior wall still standing, covered with sculpture,
which includes, among other devices, a procession of
tigers or lynxes. In the interior, massive sculptured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
pillars and door-posts, with carved zapote lintels appear,
but what seemed to Mr Stephens "the greatest
gem of aboriginal art which on the whole Continent
of America now survives," was the series of paintings
in bright colors which cover the wall and ceiling of
one of the chambers. The paintings are so much
damaged and the plaster so scratched and fallen, that
the connection of the whole cannot be made out, but
detached subjects were copied, one of which is the
boat represented in the cut, inserted here because of
the rarity of all species of watercraft in our surviving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
relics of aboriginal decoration. The other paintings
represent human figures in various postures and occupations,
battles, processions, houses, trees, and other
objects. Blue, red, yellow, and green are the colors
employed, all the human figures moreover being tinted
a reddish brown. It is, however, the supposed resemblance
of these figures to some of the Aztec
sculpture and picture-writings that gave this room
and the one below it in the same building their great
importance in Mr. Stephens' eyes. We shall be better
qualified to appreciate this resemblance after our
study of Mexican antiquities in a future chapter.
The lower room referred to has its inner surface exposed
to the open air, the outer wall having fallen.
It is covered with figures sculptured in bas-relief, also
originally painted, of which a specimen is shown in
the cut, consisting of human forms, each with plumed
head-dress, and bearing in his hand what seems to
be a bunch of spears or arrows, marching in a procession,
or as the natives say, engaged in a dance.
One hundred feet from the northern and southern
ends of the parallel walls, and very probably connected
with them in the uses to which they were by their
builders applied, are the two small buildings at <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i> of the plan. The southern building is eighty-one
feet long, the northern only thirty-five, containing
a single apartment. Both are much ruined, but each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
presents the remains of two sculptured columns, and
one of them has carvings on the walls and ceilings
of its chamber besides. A horizontal row of circular
holes in the exterior walls are conjectured by M.
Viollet-le-Duc to have held timbers which supported
a kind of outer balcony or sun-shade.<a id="FNanchor_V-78" href="#Footnote_V-78" class="fnanchor">[V-78]</a></p>

whole being in an excellent state of preservation.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
The three doorways lead into a corridor extending
the whole length of the building, forty-three feet,
through which three corresponding doorways give
access to three small apartments in the rear. Over
these doorways, and running the whole length of the
corridor, is a narrow stone tablet on which is sculptured
a row of hieroglyphics, of which the first and
best preserved portion is shown in the cut. Their similarity
to, if not identity with, the characters at Copan,
will be seen at a glance. There are traces of painting
on the walls of the three rear rooms.<a id="FNanchor_V-79" href="#Footnote_V-79" class="fnanchor">[V-79]</a> The building

<p class="sidenote">CHICHEN&mdash;THE CARACOL.</p>

<p>At F is the Caracol, or winding staircase, called
also by Norman the Dome, a building entirely different
in form and plan from any we have seen. Of the
two supporting rectangular terraces, the lower is one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
hundred and fifty by two hundred and twenty-three
feet, and the upper is fifty-five by eighty feet. A
stairway of twenty steps, forty-five feet wide, leads
up to the former, and another of sixteen steps, forty-two
feet wide, to the latter. The lower stairway had
a balustrade formed of two intertwined serpents. On
the upper platform is the Caracol, a circular building
twenty-two feet in diameter and about twenty-four
feet high, its roof being dome-shaped instead of flat.
The annexed section and ground plan illustrate its
peculiar construction. Two narrow corridors, with
plastered and painted walls, extend entirely round the
circumference, and the centre is apparently a solid
mass of masonry.<a id="FNanchor_V-80" href="#Footnote_V-80" class="fnanchor">[V-80]</a></p>

<p class="caption">The Caracol at Chichen.</p>
</div>

<p>The only remaining monument at Chichen which
demands particular mention is that at C on the plan.
Here occur large numbers, three hundred and eighty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
having been counted, of small square columns from
three to six feet high, each composed of several separate
pieces, one placed on another, standing in rows
of from three to five abreast, round an open space
some four hundred feet square, and also extending irregularly
in other directions in connection with various
mounds. The use of these columns is entirely
unknown; but any structure which they may have
supported must have been of wood, since absolutely
no vestiges remain.<a id="FNanchor_V-81" href="#Footnote_V-81" class="fnanchor">[V-81]</a> Besides the monuments described,
there are the usual heaps of ruins, mounds,
fallen walls, and sculptured blocks, scattered over the
plain for miles in every direction. Chichen was evidently
a great capital and religious centre, and its
ruins present, as the reader has doubtless noticed,
very many points of contrast with those of the central
or Uxmal group.<a id="FNanchor_V-82" href="#Footnote_V-82" class="fnanchor">[V-82]</a></p>

<p>Ruins are mentioned by Mr Wappäus as existing
at Tinum, a short distance north-west of Chichen;
and are also indicated, on Malte-Brun's map already
referred to, at Espita, still farther north, and at Xocen,
a few miles south of Valladolid. At Sitax, near Tinum,
a vase, 'something of the Etruscan shape,' from
some of the ruined cities, was seen by Mr Norman.
At Coba, eastward from Valladolid, the curate of
Chemax, in a report of his district prepared for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
government, described slightly ranges of buildings in
two stories. They are said to be built of stones, each
of which measures six square yards; this is very likely
an error, and no other peculiarities were spoken
of worthy of mention. The same cura discovered on
the hacienda of Kantunile far north-eastward toward
the coast several mounds, and in one of them three
skeletons, at whose head were two earthen vases.
One of these was filled with the relics shown in the
cuts on the following page, consisting of implements,
ornaments, and two carved shells. The shell carvings
are in low relief, and the arrow-heads, with which
the other vase was nearly filled, were of obsidian, a
material not known to exist in Yucatan, and which
must consequently be supposed to have been brought
from more northern volcanic states of Mexico, where
it formed the usual material of knives and many other
aboriginal implements and weapons. Besides these
different articles, was a horn-handled penknife in the
same vase, proving that this burial deposit was made
subsequently to the coming of Europeans.<a id="FNanchor_V-83" href="#Footnote_V-83" class="fnanchor">[V-83]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">NORTHERN GROUP.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS AT TICUL.</p>

<p class="p2">I now come to the northern group of Yucatan Antiquities,
which is separated from the Uxmal group by
the low sierra before mentioned as running from north-west
to south-east across this portion of the state.
First in this group are the ruins of the ancient Ticul,
on the hacienda of San Francisco close to the modern
town of Ticul, and just across the sierra from Nohcacab.
Here are thirty-six mounds, or pyramids, all
visible from one of the highest when the trees are free
from foliage. Most of the elevations support buildings,
but these are so completely ruined that nothing
can be known of the original city, save that it must
have been of great extent. These ruined piles have
served as quarries to supply building material at
Ticul, which is almost entirely built of stone. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
relics are preserved in the town, but the only one particularly
noticed is the earthen vase shown in the cut.
It is five inches in diameter and four and a half
inches high, and the reader will notice a similarity of
style between the figures on its front and those carved
on the burial relics of Kantunile previously shown.
Between two of the mounds of San Francisco, a
square stone wall filled with earth and stones was
opened, and in it, under a large flat stone, was found
a skeleton sitting with knees against the stomach and
hands clasping the neck, facing the west. In connection
with this skeleton were found a large earthen
vase, or water-jar, empty, and a deer's-horn needle,
sharp at one end and having an eye at the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Mr Norman calls this group of mounds Ichmul, supposes
them all to be sepulchres, and says that several
have been opened and disclosed sitting skeletons, with
pots at their feet, and even interior rooms. M. Waldeck
briefly mentions in many parts of his work the
ruins of Tixualajtun, which may possibly be identical
with Ticul, and which bear carved stones, indicating
by their number and position in the walls an age of
at least three thousand years.<a id="FNanchor_V-84" href="#Footnote_V-84" class="fnanchor">[V-84]</a></p>

<p>About ten miles northward of Ticul, and twenty-five
miles southward of Mérida is the rancho of San
Joaquin, included in the hacienda of Xcanchakan, on
which are the remains of Mayapan, the ancient Maya
capital. According to the traditional annals of the
country Mayapan was destroyed by an enemy, in one
of the many civil conflicts that desolated Yucatan,
not much more than a century before the Spanish conquest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Numerous mounds, scattered blocks, and a few
ruined buildings are all that remain to recall the city's
ancient splendor. The best preserved mound is that
shown in the preceding cut, one hundred feet square at
the base, and sixty feet high, with a stairway twenty-five
feet wide in the centre of each side. The top is
a plain stone platform, with no signs of its ever having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
supported any building. Most of the sculptured
fragments contain only parts of ornamental designs
and are fitted with tenons by which they were probably
secured on the front walls, as at Uxmal. One
building of the ordinary type was sufficiently entire to
show the triangular ceiling. A circular building similar
to that described at Chichen was also noticed. It
is twenty-five feet in diameter, and twenty-four feet
high, with only a single doorway facing the west. A
single corridor only three feet wide runs entirely round
the edifice, the outer wall being five feet thick, and
the inner wall is a solid circular mass of stone and
mortar nine feet in thickness. The interior walls of
the corridor are plastered with several coats of stucco,
and yet retain vestiges of yellow, blue, red, and white
paint. The preceding cut shows the exterior of this
structure, and also gives a good idea of the similar one
at Chichen. On a terrace of the mound which supports
this dome, are eight round columns, two and a half
feet in diameter, and each composed of five stones
placed one upon another. Among the sculptured
blocks with which the country for miles around is
strewn, are some which differ from those mentioned as
parts of façade decorations. They are rudely carved,
and each represents a subject complete in itself. Two
of these, one four and the other three feet high,
together with some of the decorative fragments alluded
to, are shown in the cut on the opposite page.
An idol was also found in one of the subterranean passages
of a senote. The inhabitants of the locality report
that the ruins extend over the plain within a
circumference of three miles, and that the foundations
yet remain of a wall that once surrounded the city.<a id="FNanchor_V-85" href="#Footnote_V-85" class="fnanchor">[V-85]</a>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS OF TIHOO AT MÉRIDA.</p>

<p>Mérida, the capital of Yucatan, was built by the
Spanish conquerors on the ruins of the aboriginal city
of Tihoo, the ancient mounds furnishing material to
the builders of the modern town. Only very slight
vestiges of Tihoo remain; yet in the lower cloisters
of the Franciscan convent, which is known to have
been erected over an ancient mound and building, the
Spanish architects left one of the peculiar aboriginal
arches intact, unless we suppose that they imitated
such an arch in their own work, which is most unlikely.
Bishop Landa describes and illustrates with
a ground plan one of the largest and finest of the
Tihoo structures, as it was in the sixteenth century.
In most respects his description agrees exactly with
the ruins of the grander class already mentioned.
The supporting mound has two retreating terraces on
all sides except the western, which side seems to have
been perpendicular to its full height. Stairways running
the whole length of the mound lead up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
eastern slopes, and on the summit platform is a courtyard
surrounded by four buildings, like the Casa de
Monjas at Uxmal. A gateway leads through the
centre of both eastern and western buildings, and one
of these gateways is represented by Landa as having
a round arch, the other being of the ordinary form.
The buildings are divided into a single range of small
apartments opening on the court, except the southern,
which has two large rooms, and in front of which was
a gallery supported by a row of square pillars. A
round building or room is also mentioned in connection
with the western range. Landa also mentions
several other structures, including the one over whose
ruins the Franciscan convent was built. M. Waldeck
mentions an excavation in a garden of the city,
which is twenty-three by thirty feet, and fifteen feet
deep, with double walls three and six feet thick, where
the bones of a tapir and other bones were dug up.
He also saw here several idols collected from different
parts.<a id="FNanchor_V-86" href="#Footnote_V-86" class="fnanchor">[V-86]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PYRAMID AND COLUMNS OF AKÉ.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five miles east of Mérida, at a place
called Aké, barely mentioned in the annals of the
conquest as the locality where a battle was fought
between the Spaniards and Mayas, are the ruins of
an aboriginal city; ruins which, according to Mr Stephens,
their only visitor, have a ruder, older, and more
cyclopean air than any others seen. Some of the
stones here employed are seven feet long. One remarkable
feature is a pyramid, whose summit platform
is fifty by two hundred and twenty-five feet, and
supports thirty-six columns, each four feet square, and
from fourteen to sixteen feet high. These columns
are arranged in three parallel rows, ten feet apart
from north to south, and fifteen feet from east to west.
Each column is composed of several square stones.
A stairway one hundred and thirty-seven feet wide,
with steps seventeen inches high, and four feet five
inches deep, leads up the southern slope. Of this
mound Mr Stephens says: "It was a new and extraordinary
feature, entirely different from any we
had seen, and at the very end of our journey, when
we supposed ourselves familiar with the character of
American ruins, threw over them a new air of mystery."
Between Mérida and Mayapan is mentioned
a stone wall, which crosses the road and extends far on
either side into the forest. Near by is also an aguada,
said by the inhabitants to be of artificial formation.<a id="FNanchor_V-87" href="#Footnote_V-87" class="fnanchor">[V-87]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF IZAMAL.</p>

<p>Izamal, something more than twenty miles further
eastward, was a city of great importance in aboriginal
times, as we shall see in the following volume. Two
or three immense pyramids are all the vestiges that
remain of its former greatness. The largest mound
is between seven and eight hundred feet long, and between
fifty and sixty feet high, and Mr Stephens
"ascertained beyond all doubt" that it has interior
chambers, concerning which he very strangely gives
no further information. M. Charnay's photograph
shows that this mound was in two receding stages,
on the slopes of the upper of which steps are still to
be seen. The modern town is built on the site of the
ancient city, and the mounds as elsewhere have furnished
the material of the later structures. The
upper portion of a pyramid facing the one already
mentioned was leveled down, and on the lower platform
was erected the Franciscan church and convent.
Another smaller mound is in the courtyards of two
private houses, and on its side near the base is the
cara gigantesca, or gigantic face, shown in the cut.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
It is seven feet wide and seven feet eight inches high.
The features were first rudely formed by small rough
stones, fixed in the side of the mound by means of
mortar, and afterward perfected with a stucco so hard
that it has successfully resisted for centuries the action
of air and water. There were signs of a row of similar
stucco ornaments extending along the side of the
mound; and either on this mound or another near by,
M. Charnay photographed a similarly formed face,
which is twelve feet high. These colossal stucco faces
are the distinctive features of the ruins of Izamal,
nothing of the kind appearing elsewhere in Yucatan,
although a slight resemblance may be traced to the
gigantic faces in stone at Copan. Bishop Landa describes
one of the Izamal structures as it appeared in
his time, and adds a plan to his description. He represents
the supporting pyramid as being over one
hundred feet high, with a very steep stairway and
very high steps, being built in a semi-circular form on
one side. According to his statement the edifices
were eleven or twelve in number, standing near together.
Lizana, another of the early writers on
Yucatan, mentions five of the sacred mounds supporting
buildings which were already in ruins in his time,
and he also gives the Maya name of each temple with
its meaning. It should be noted, moreover, that Izamal
is, according to the annals of Yucatan, the burial
place of Zamná, the great semi-divine founder of the
ancient Maya power.<a id="FNanchor_V-88" href="#Footnote_V-88" class="fnanchor">[V-88]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SENOTE OF BOLONCHEN.</p>

<p>I now come to the southern group of Maya antiquities,
over which I may pass rapidly, beginning with
the ruins of Ytsimpte near the village of Bolonchen,
some fifteen miles south of Chunhuhu, the most south-western
ruin of the central group. By the kindness
of the cura and the industry of the natives this ruined
city was cleared of all obstacles in the shape of vegetation,
and its thorough exploration was thus rendered
easy; but unfortunately no corresponding results followed,
since no new features whatever were discovered.
Here are undoubtedly the remains of a great city, but
most of the walls, and all of the sculptured decorations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
have fallen. Bolonchen means 'nine wells,' so
named from a group of natural wells in the plaza.
These fail for several months in the dry season, and
then the inhabitants resort to a senote in the neighborhood,
which, as one of the most wonderful in the
peninsula, is shown, or rather one of its several passages
is shown, in the cut. By a series of rude ladders
water is brought from springs over fifteen hundred
feet from the opening at the surface, and at a perpendicular
depth of over four hundred feet.</p>

the single brief exploration by Mr Stephens, its only
visitor, is barely sufficient to excite our curiosity respecting
its unknown wonders. Only one building
was examined with care; this has three receding stories.
The western front was carefully cleared, and,
sketched by Mr Catherwood, resembling very closely
the other three-storied structures before described.
But at the last moment it was discovered that this
was only the rear wall, and that the eastern front
"presented the tottering remains of the grandest
structure that now rears its ruined head in the forests
of Yucatan." The dimensions and arrangement of
rooms of the lower story, differing from any that have
been met further north, are shown in the accompanying
ground plan, together with the stairways that
lead up to the second story. Besides the grand central
eastern staircase, there are two interior stairways,
each in two flights, leading up to the platform of the
second and third stories from the rooms of the western
range. This is the first instance of interior stairs,
but the method of their construction is not explained.
The western wall of the third story has no doorways.
On the platform of the second story stand two high
buildings like towers, ornamented with stucco, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the third platform two similar structures at the head
of the stairway before the central entrance. These
upper rooms have plain walls and ceilings. The lower
ones present numerous imprints of the ever-present
red hand, and one of them has a painted stone in the
tier over the arch, as at Kewick. At the points
marked <i>a</i> in the plan, are sculptured tablets of stone
fixed in the exterior walls, one of which is shown in
the cut. Each tablet is composed of several pieces
of stone, and the sculptured figures are naturally much
worn by exposure to the air and rain. Two circular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
openings to <i>chultunes</i>, or cisterns, like those at Uxmal
and elsewhere, were found near by. Another Labphak
structure formed a parallelogram, surrounding a
courtyard, and presenting two peculiarities; the entrance
to the court was by stairways leading over the
flat roof of one of the ranges of buildings; and the
ornamentation of the court façades was in stucco instead
of sculptured stone. With this slight description
I am obliged to leave this most interesting city,
whose solitude, so far as I know, has remained undisturbed
for thirty years and more since Messrs Stephens
and Catherwood spent two days in the halls of
its departed greatness. Now as then, "it remains a
rich and almost unbroken field for the future explorer."</p>

<p>At Iturbide, the south-western frontier town of
modern Yucatan, there is a mound of ruins in the
plaza, and also a well some four feet in diameter, and
twenty-five feet deep, stoned with hewn blocks without
mortar; its sides polished by long usage, and
grooved by the ropes employed in drawing water.
This well is considered the work of the antiguos, and
another similar one was seen near by. In the outskirts
of Iturbide the plain is dotted with the mounds
and stone buildings of the ancient town of Zibilnocac.
Thirty-three mounds were counted, but the walls of
the buildings had all fallen except one, which presented
the peculiarity of square elevations, or towers,
with sculptured façades, at each end and in the middle.
Its rooms also preserved traces of interesting
paintings, representing processions of human figures
whose flesh was colored red.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AGUADAS OF THE SOUTH.</p>

<p>At the rancho of Noyaxche, a few miles distant, is
a seemingly natural pond, which, being explored by
the proprietor during a very dry season, proved to
have an artificial bottom of flat stones many layers
thick, pierced in the centre with four wells, and round
the circumference with over four hundred small pits,
or cisterns. At Macoba, twelve or fifteen miles eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
is another similar aguada, and ruined buildings
are also found, actually occupied by the natives as
dwellings. Mankeesh is another locality in this
region where extensive ruins are reported to exist.
At the rancho of Jalal is an aguada similar to the
one mentioned at Noyaxche, the forms of the wells
and cisterns, pierced in its paved bottom being illustrated
by the cut. Upwards of forty deep wells were
discovered by the natives in the immediate neighborhood.
Yakatzib is another place near by, where
ruined buildings were seen. Becanchen is a town of
six thousand inhabitants, and owes its existence to
the discovery of a group of ancient wells, partially
artificial, and a stream of running water. Fragments
of ancient structures are built into the walls of the
town.<a id="FNanchor_V-89" href="#Footnote_V-89" class="fnanchor">[V-89]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Only the monuments found on or near the coast of

<img src="images/i255.jpg" width="533" height="341" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Plan of Tuloom.</p>
</div>

<p>Tuloom is the most important city of antiquity on
the eastern coast, standing in about 20° 10´. It is
undoubtedly one of the many aboriginal towns whose
'towers' excited so much wonder in the minds of the
first European voyagers along this coast. It presents
several marked contrasts with the other monuments
that have been described, not only in the construction
and arrangement of its edifices, but in its
site, since it is built on a high bluff on the very border
of the sea, commanding a view of wild and diversified
natural scenery, differing widely from the somewhat
monotonous plain that constitutes for the most part
the surface of the peninsula. Tuloom has only been
visited by Mr Stephens, and his exploration was
nearly at the end of his long journey, when the keen
edge of his antiquarian zeal was naturally somewhat
blunted by fatigue, sickness, and a desire to return
home. Moreover, countless hordes of mosquitos, with
a persistent malignity unsurpassed in the annals of
their race, scorning the aid even of their natural allies
in the defense of Central American ruins, the garrapatas
and fleas, proved victorious over antiquarian
heroism, and drove the foreign invaders from their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
stronghold. The annexed cut is a ground plan of the
ruins so far as explored, and we notice at once a novel
feature in the wall A, A, that bounds them on three
sides&mdash;the first well-authenticated instance which we
have met of a walled Maya town. A precipitous cliff
rising from the waters of the ocean makes a wall unnecessary
on the eastern side, but on the other sides
the wall is in excellent preservation, stretching six
hundred and fifty feet from east to west, and fifteen
hundred feet from north to south, from eight to thirteen
feet thick, and built of rough flat stones without
mortar. The height is not stated. On each of the
inland corners at C, C, is a small structure, twelve
feet square, with two doors, which may be considered
a watch-tower, and which is shown in the cut on the
next page. Five gateways, each five feet wide, at B,
B, B, give access to the city. Within the walls the
largest and most imposing structure is that at D,
known as the Castle, which stands on the cliff overlooking
the sea. A solid mass of masonry thirty feet
square and about thirty feet in height, ascended on the
western side by a massive stairway of the same width
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
with solid balustrades, supports on its summit a
building of the same size as the foundation, and about
fifteen feet high. The doorway at the head of the
stairway is wide, and its lintel is supported by two pillars.
Over the doorway are niches in the wall, one of
which contains fragments of a statue. The interior is
divided into two corridors connected by a single doorway,
the front one having what are described as 'stone
benches' at the ends, and the rear range having a
similar bench along one of its sides. The rear, or sea,
wall is very thick and has no doorways, but several
small openings of oblong shape form the nearest approach
to windows found in Yucatan. The corridors
have ceilings of the usual type, the doorways are furnished
with stone rings for the support of doors, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the imprint of the red hand appears on the interior
walls. Against each end of the solid foundation is
built a wing in two stories, thirty-five feet long, making
the whole length of the Castle one hundred feet.
The upper story of each wing consists of two apartments,
one of which is twenty by twenty-four feet.
Two columns, ornamented with stucco, stand in the
centre of the room, of which the ceiling has fallen,
although a succession of holes along the top of the
walls indicate that it had been flat and supported by
timbers. The building north of the Castle, at E, contains
a single room seven by twelve feet, with a raised
step or bench at each end, and much defaced painted
ornaments in stucco on its walls. Over the doorway
on the outside is the figure we have met before, standing
on the hands with legs spread apart. The building
close to the Castle on the south has four columns in
the centre of a room nineteen by forty feet, and also
in another room are fragments of a sculptured tablet.
A senote with artificial steps, which supplied water to
the ancient inhabitants, is included within the enclosure
at K. At H is a building remarkable for its
roof, which differs radically from the usual Maya type.
Four timbers fifteen feet long and six inches thick
stretch across the room from wall to wall, and crossways
on these timbers are placed smaller timbers ten
feet long and three inches thick close together, and
the whole covered with a thick layer of coarse pebbles
in mortar. Several other buildings evidently had
similar roofs originally, else it might be suspected that
this one had undergone modern improvements, especially
as an altar was found in it with traces of use at
no very remote period. In this building also sea-shells
take the place of stone rings at the sides of the
doorways. One of the structures marked G on the
plan has two stories. The front is decorated with
stucco, and the doorway of the lower story occupies
nearly the whole front, its top being supported by four
pillars. The interior plan is similar to that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Castle at Chichen Itza, since a corridor extends round
three sides of a central apartment. The interior walls
of both room and corridor are painted, and in the latter
is an altar on which copal is supposed to have been
burned. The second story, which has no stairway or
other visible means of approach, differs from all other
upper stories in Yucatan, in standing directly over the
central lower room, instead of over a solid mass of
masonry as elsewhere. Among other ruins near this,
two stone tablets with indistinct traces of sculpture
were noticed. The cut shows one of several small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
structures found at Tuloom outside the walls, and
probably intended as altars or adoratorios. This building
is twelve by fifteen feet and contains a single room
where a copal altar appears. Tuloom was undoubtedly
one of the cities seen by the early voyagers along this
coast, and from the perfect state of preservation of
many of the monuments, especially of the stucco ornament
resembling a pine-apple shown in the last cut,
Mr Stephens believes that the city was occupied long
after the conquest of other parts of the peninsula.
At Tancar, a few miles north of Tuloom, are many
remains of small ancient edifices, much dilapidated
and not described.<a id="FNanchor_V-92" href="#Footnote_V-92" class="fnanchor">[V-92]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Building at Cozumel.</p>
</div>

<p>The island of Cozumel has not been explored, by reason
of the dense growth which covers its surface, but in
a small clearing on the shore two buildings were discovered.
One of them is shown in the preceding cut.
It is sixteen feet square, with plain exterior walls
formerly plastered and painted. A doorway in the
centre of each side opens into a corridor only twenty
inches wide, extending round a central chamber five
by eight and a half feet, with one doorway. The
other is similar but larger. One of the dome-shaped
cisterns was also found on the island. Here is also
a ruined Spanish church, which very probably furnished
the cross with a crucified Christ, preserved in
Mérida as an aboriginal relic, and much talked of
by enthusiasts who formerly believed that Christianity
was introduced into America long before the Spaniards
came. On the main land opposite the island ruined
stone buildings are also visible from the sea, as they
were to Grijalva and Córdova in the sixteenth century.
Pole, or Popole, is one of the localities somewhat
further north where ruins are located on the
maps.<a id="FNanchor_V-93" href="#Footnote_V-93" class="fnanchor">[V-93]</a></p>

<p>At Point Nisuc Mr Stephens locates ruins on his map,
as does Malte-Brun at the mouth of the River Petampich
a little further south, and the former also mentions
stone buildings as visible on the barren island of Kancune.
On the northern point of Mugeres Island,
known to the early voyagers as Point, or Cape, Mugeres,
are two small buildings of the usual type. One
of them, fifteen by twenty-eight feet, resting on a solid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
foundation with perpendicular sides in which a narrow
stairway was cut, is located on a cliff at the extreme
point of the island.<a id="FNanchor_V-94" href="#Footnote_V-94" class="fnanchor">[V-94]</a></p>

<p>At Cayo Ratones is a ruin according to Malte-Brun's
map; and Cape Catoche was the location of
one of the cities seen by the Spaniards in the sixteenth
century, this early discovery being perhaps the
only authority for M. Waldeck's statement that a
ruined city may there be found.<a id="FNanchor_V-95" href="#Footnote_V-95" class="fnanchor">[V-95]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NORTHERN COAST RELICS.</p>

<p>Following the coast westward, an ancient mound
is seen at Yalahao, the map shows another at Emal,
and Monte Cuyo is a lofty mound, reported to have no
traces of buildings, visible from far out at sea. This
latter may perhaps be identical with "a small Hill
by the Sea, call'd the <i>Mount</i>," mentioned by the old
English voyager Dampier, who says: "I was never
ashore here, but have met with some well acquainted
with the Place, who are all of opinion that this Mount
was not natural, but the Work of Men."<a id="FNanchor_V-96" href="#Footnote_V-96" class="fnanchor">[V-96]</a> Two pyramids
are reported further east, near the Rio Lagartos,
but their existence rests on no very reliable authority.<a id="FNanchor_V-97" href="#Footnote_V-97" class="fnanchor">[V-97]</a>
Two mounds, once covered with buildings, at
the port of Silan, are the only other monuments to be
mentioned on the northern coast. One of these latter
is of great size, being four hundred feet long and fifty
feet high. The padre could remember when the building
on the other, known as the Castle, was still standing.<a id="FNanchor_V-98" href="#Footnote_V-98" class="fnanchor">[V-98]</a></p>

<p>On or near the western coast are few monuments
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of antiquity worthy of note. At Maxcanú, some
twenty-five miles north-west from Uxmal, a locality
visited by Stephens during his trip toward the coast,
are several mounds covered with ruins, which present
no peculiarities. But in the interior of one of these
mounds was found a gallery four feet wide and seven
feet high, with triangular-arched ceiling, extending
several hundred feet with many branches and angles.
Before Mr Stephens' visit this was supposed by the
inhabitants of the region to be a subterranean passage,
or cave, known as Satun Sat, or the Labyrinth.
The presence of this gallery of course suggests the
idea that others of the Yucatan pyramids may contain
similar ones, and that their exploration might
lead to important results. On the hacienda of Sijoh,
a few leagues nearer the coast, is a large group of
ruined mounds and buildings, presenting nothing new,
except that the stones of one of them were much
larger than usual, one being noticed that was three
by six feet. In a kind of courtyard in the midst of
these mounds are standing many huge stones, resembling
in their situation and size the monoliths of Copan,
but they bear no marks of sculpture, being rough
and unhewn as if just taken from the quarry. The
largest is fourteen feet high, four feet wide and a foot
and a half thick. At Tankuché one apartment of a
ruined building has its walls and ceiling decorated
with paintings in bright colors, but the room was
filled up with rubbish, and nothing definite could be
made out respecting the designs, except in the case
of one ornament which seemed to resemble a mask
found at Palenque. Ruins are reported also at Becal,
in the same region.<a id="FNanchor_V-99" href="#Footnote_V-99" class="fnanchor">[V-99]</a> At the mouth of the Rio Jaïna
a tumulus, with pottery and spear-heads on its surface,
is mentioned by Waldeck and Norman, and perhaps
at the same place under the name of Chuncana, ruins
are indicated on Malte-Brun's map.

<p class="caption">Campeche Idols in Terra Cotta.</p>
</div>

<p>Further south, in the region extending from Campeche
to Laguna de Terminos there is only the vaguest
information respecting antiquities. The city of Campeche
itself is said to be built over extensive artificial
galleries, or catacombs, supposed to have been devoted
by the ancient people to sepulchral uses; but I find
no satisfactory description of these excavations. On
the Rio Champoton, some leagues from the coast,
ruins are reported concerning which nothing definite
is known. From the tumulus mentioned, "and other
places contiguous to ruins of immense cities, in the
vicinity of Campeachy," Mr Norman claims to have
obtained "some skeletons and bones that have evidently
been interred for ages, also a collection of idols,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
fragments, flint spear-heads, and axes; besides sundry
articles of pottery-ware, well wrought, glazed, and
burnt." The cuts on the preceding pages show five of
these idols, which are hollow and have small balls
within to rattle at every movement. Padre Camacho
is also said to have collected at Campeche a museum
composed of many relics from different localities, many
of them interesting but not particularly described.<a id="FNanchor_V-100" href="#Footnote_V-100" class="fnanchor">[V-100]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MAYA CALZADAS.</p>

<p>Besides the monuments that have been described,
the remains of ancient paved roads, or calzadas, have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
been found in several different parts of the state. The
traditionary history of the country represents the
great cities and religious centres as connected, in the
time of their original splendor and prosperity, by broad
smooth paved ways, constructed for the convenience of
the rulers in sending dispatches from place to place.
These roads are even reported to have stretched beyond
the limits of the peninsula, affording access to
the neighboring kingdoms of Guatemala, Chiapas, and
Tabasco. Modern discoveries lend some probability to
these reports. Cozumel was one of these great religious
centres from which roads led in every direction,
and Cogolludo says that in his time "were to be seen
vestiges of calzadas which cross the whole kingdom,
said to end at its eastern border on the sea-shore."
The cura of Chemax, speaking of Coba, far eastward
of Chichen toward the coast, says "there is a calzada,
or paved road, of ten or twelve yards in width, running
to the south-east to a limit that has not been
discovered with certainty, but some aver that it goes
in the direction of Chichen Itza." Bishop Landa
mentions "a fine broad calzada extending about two
stone's throw to a well" from one of the Chichen structures.
Izamal was another much-frequented shrine,
from which Lizana tells us "they had constructed four
roads, or calzadas, towards the four winds, which
reached the ends of the county, and even extended
to Tabasco, Guatemala, and Chiapas; and even now
are seen in many places portions and traces of these
roads." Landa also states that between Izamal and
Mérida, "there are to-day signs of there having existed
a very beautiful paved way." In the same
locality, running parallel to the modern road for several
miles, M. Charnay found "a magnificent road,
from seven to eight mètres wide, whose foundation is
of immense stones surmounted by a concrete perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
preserved, which is covered with a coating of cement
two inches thick. This road is everywhere about a
mètre and a half above the surface of the ground.
The coating of cement seems as if put on yesterday;"
the whole being buried, however, some sixteen inches
deep in soil and vegetable accumulations. The Cura
Carillo and party found in 1845 one of these paved
roads four and a half varas wide, running parallel with
the modern road south-eastward from Uxmal, and said
by the natives to connect the latter city with Nohpat.
It is perhaps the same calzada, in Maya <i>Sacbé</i>, 'a
road of white stone,' that has given a name to the Sacbé
ruins, and is described by Mr Stephens as "a broken
platform or roadway of stone, about eight feet wide
and eight or ten inches high, crossing the road, and
running off into the woods on both sides," reported to
extend from Uxmal to Kabah.<a id="FNanchor_V-101" href="#Footnote_V-101" class="fnanchor">[V-101]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">GENERAL RÉSUMÉ.</p>

<p class="p2">Having now completed my detailed description of
Maya antiquities in all parts of the peninsula where
aboriginal relics have been seen or reported, I have
thought it best to give in conclusion a general view of
these antiquities, their peculiarities, the contrasts and
similarities which they present among themselves and
when compared with more southern monuments, together
with such general remarks and conclusions as
their examination may seem to warrant.</p>

<p>The comparatively level and uniform surface of the
peninsula left the aboriginal builders little choice in
the location of their cities and temples, yet a preference
for a broken hilly region may be traced in the
fact that the central, or Uxmal, group, the most
crowded with ancient monuments, corresponds with
the principal transverse ranges of the peninsula; likewise
the eastern coast cities rest generally on elevated
bluffs overlooking the sea. In the selection of sites,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
however, as in the construction of their cities, security
against enemies seems to have been not at all, or at
best very slightly, considered. None of the cities on
the plains are located with any view to defence, or have
any traces of fortifications to guard their approaches.
Tuloom, on the eastern coast, was indeed surrounded
by a strong wall on which watch-towers were placed;
but of all the Yucatan cities this is best guarded by
its natural position and would seem to have least need
of artificial defences. Some slight remains of walls
are seen at Uxmal and Mayapan, but insufficient to
prove that these were walled cities. A wall more or
less perfect is also reported at Chacchob. No structure
has been found which partakes in any way of the
nature of a fort, or which appears to have been erected
with a view to military defense. It is true the numerous
pyramids and their superimposed buildings
would serve as a refuge for non-combattants, as well
as property, and would afford facilities for defense in a
hand-to-hand conflict, or perhaps against any attack
by men armed with aboriginal weapons; but would in
nowise serve as a protection to the dwellings or fields
of the populace which must be supposed to have dotted
the plains for a wide extent about the palaces of
the nobility and temples of the gods.</p>

<p>In the laying out both of cities and of individual
structures, no fixed plan was followed that can now be
ascertained, except that a majority of the edifices face
in general terms the cardinal points; that is, as nearly
as these points would naturally be determined by observation
of the rising and setting sun. The oft-repeated
statement that all the temples and palaces were exactly
oriented is altogether unsupported by facts.</p>

<p>The materials employed by the Maya builders were
limestone, mortar, and wood. The limestone used is
that which, covered with a few feet of sand or soil,
forms the substratum of the whole peninsula. It is
soft and easily worked, and may be readily quarried
in any part of the state. Somewhat strangely, none
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
of the quarries which supplied the stone for building,
or for sculptured decorations and idols, have ever been
found;&mdash;at least none such have been reported by any
explorer.<a id="FNanchor_V-102" href="#Footnote_V-102" class="fnanchor">[V-102]</a> With very few exceptions, such as in the
case of the city wall at Tuloom, the stone employed,
whether rough or hewn, was laid in mortar. Cement
was also used on roofs and floors; plaster on interior
walls; and stucco in exterior decorations. Mortar,
cement, plaster, and stucco were presumably composed
of the same materials, lime and sand, mixed in different
proportions according to the use for which it was
designed. No satisfactory analysis seems to have been
made of the mortar, nor is anything definite known
respecting the method of its manufacture, or the
source from which lime was obtained. That the material
was of excellent quality is proved by the resistance
it has offered for at least three centuries to
tropical rains and the inroads of tropical vegetation.
It is nearly as hard as the stone blocks which it holds
together, and to its excellence the preservation of the
Yucatan monuments is in great measure due.<a id="FNanchor_V-103" href="#Footnote_V-103" class="fnanchor">[V-103]</a></p>

<p>Wood was employed by the Maya builders only for
lintels, for timbers of unknown use stretched across
the rooms from side to side of the ceilings, in one case
at Chichen for beams to support the regular stone
arches of the roof, and, at Tuloom only, for the support
of a flat cement roof. The only wood mentioned
is the zapote, native to some parts of the peninsula,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
extremely hard and heavy, but not resinous or particularly
well fitted to resist decay or the ravages of
worms. It seems remarkable that any portion of this
woodwork should have survived even their three or
four centuries of unquestioned age;&mdash;and, indeed, few
or none of the lintels of outer doorways exposed to
the weather have remained unbroken.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon a site for a proposed edifice, the
Maya builder invariably erected an artificial elevation
on which it might rest. And this peculiarity is observed,
not only in Yucatan, but, as we shall see in
many other portions of the Pacific States, no less universally
in regions where natural hills abound than on
level plains. In several places, however, the artificial
structure rests on a natural hill of slight elevation, as
at Chack and Zayi; in other cases advantage is taken
of a small hill to save labor in the accumulation of
material, as at Uxmal; and in one instance at Chichen
the appearance of a mound is gained by excavating
the surrounding earth. Buildings resting on the natural
surface of the earth are unknown, as are also subterranean
apartments or galleries of artificial construction,
excepting only the reported catacombs under the
city of Campeche. The bases of the foundation structures,
or pyramids, are usually rectangular, the largest
dimensions being fifteen hundred feet square at Zayi,
while many have sides of three to eight hundred feet.
They diminish in size towards the summit, from
twenty to fifty feet high in the case of the larger
mounds, and from sixty to ninety feet in some of the
smaller ones. Most of the larger mounds have two
or more terrace-platforms on their slope. The mass of
the mound is composed of rough stones and fragments
generally in mortar, making a coarse concrete; the
outer surface is faced with hewn stones, not generally
laid so as to form steps, as seems to have been the case
at Copan, but so as to present a smooth surface on the
slope. It is uncertain whether some of the larger
terrace-platforms were paved with regular blocks or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
not. The corners are often rounded. Sculptured decorations
occur in a few instances, as on the Pyramid
at Uxmal; and at Izamal a row of faces in stucco
adorn the base. A stairway always occupies the centre
of one side, often of more than one side. Some of
these stairways are over a hundred feet wide, and their
steps are rarely arranged with any reference to convenience
in mounting. Balustrades remain on some
stairways, ornamented in a few instances by sculptured
monsters' heads. There is nothing to show that the
surface of the slopes or the steps were covered with
cement. The supporting stone structure of one building
at Chichen and also of one at Tuloom has perpendicular
instead of sloping sides. All the pyramids are
truncated, none forming a point at the top, although
there is one or more in every group of ruins whose
summit platform presents no traces of ever having
supported buildings of any kind. Interior galleries
were explored in a mound at Maxcanú, and chambers
in the body of that at Izamal were reported; others
are solid so far as known, except that a few small
chambers have been mentioned with a vertical entrance
at the top, which may have been cisterns.</p>

<p>The edifices supported by the mounds are built
either on the summit platform, or in receding ranges,
one above another, on the slope. In the latter case
these receding ranges form the nearest approach on the
part of the Mayas to buildings of several stories, except
in one instance at Tuloom, where one room is
directly over another. In one building at Kabah the
outer wall rises from the foot of the mound, and the
inner from the summit. One building usually occupies
the summit; but in several cases four of them
enclose an interior courtyard. The buildings are long,
low, and narrow. Thirty-one feet is the greatest
height, thirty-nine the greatest width, and three hundred
and twenty-two the greatest length. The roofs
are flat and, like the floors, covered with cement. The
walls are, in proportion to the dimensions of the buildings,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
very thick, usually from three to six feet, but
sometimes nine feet. Like the pyramids, the buildings
consist of a mass of concrete, stones and mortar,
faced with hewn blocks of nearly cubical form, and of
varying dimensions rarely exceeding eighteen inches,
but found at Sijoh and Aké as large as three by six
and seven feet. Only one building has been noted
whose exterior walls are not perpendicular, but the
corners are in most cases rounded.</p>

<p>The interior has generally two, often one, and rarely
four parallel ranges of rooms, while in a few of the
smaller buildings an uninterrupted corridor extends
the whole length. Neither rooms nor corridors ever
exceed twenty feet in width or height, while the ordinary
width is eight to ten feet and the height fifteen to
eighteen feet. Sixty feet is the greatest length noted.
The walls of each room rise perpendicularly for one half
their height, and then approach each other, by the stone
blocks overlapping horizontally, to within about one
foot, the intervening space being covered with a layer
of wide flat stones, and the projecting corners being
beveled off to form a straight, or rarely a curved, surface.
In a few instances, as at Nohcacab, the sides
of the ceiling form an acute angle at the top; and
once, at Uxmal, the overlapping stones are inclined
instead of lying horizontally, forming a slight, but the
nearest, Maya approach to the true arch. This is the
only kind of ceiling found in Yucatan, except one at
Tuloom which is flat and supported by timbers
stretched across from wall to wall. I have followed
Stephens and applied the name of 'triangular arch'
to this structure of overlapping stones, although the
term may by a strict interpretation be liable to some
criticism.<a id="FNanchor_V-104" href="#Footnote_V-104" class="fnanchor">[V-104]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>The tops of the few gateways discovered are constructed
by means of the same arch as that employed
in the ceilings. One solitary arch unconnected with
any other structure has been noted at Kabah; and
in the Castle at Chichen two interior arches rest
on beams supported by stone columns instead of the
usual perpendicular walls. In some of the buildings
at Kabah and Chichen the floor of the inner range
of rooms is higher than that of the outer, being
reached by stone steps. Small round timbers extend
from side to side of the ceiling in nearly all
rooms, and at Tuloom stone benches are found along
the sides and ends.</p>

<p>Rarely do more than two rooms communicate with
each other. The doorways are on an average perhaps
four feet wide and eight feet high, with square tops
formed by zapote beams or stone lintels, which rest on
stone jambs composed of two or three pieces, or are
built into the regular wall of the building. At Chacchob
a doorway is reported wider at the top than at
the bottom. Many exterior doorways are wide and
divided into two or more entrances by stone pillars
supporting the lintels. Stone rings, or hooks, replaced
at Tuloom by shells, near the top on the inside, and
in a few cases at both top and bottom, are the only
traces of the means by which the entrances were originally
closed. Wooden lintels are almost exclusively
employed at Uxmal, but elsewhere stone is more common;
a few both of wood and stone are covered with
carved devices, as are also some of the door-posts.
Besides the doorways the rooms have no openings
whatever, no chimneys, windows, or ventilators being
found, if we except the oblong openings in the rear
wall of the Castle at Tuloom.<a id="FNanchor_V-105" href="#Footnote_V-105" class="fnanchor">[V-105]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting the rooms, aside from their decoration,
nothing remains to be noticed except the casas cerradas,
or rooms filled with solid masonry, and the
interior stairways of unexplained construction at Labphak.
Exterior stairways supported by a half arch
lead up to the top of such of the buildings as have
more than one story, and also to the summit of the
few mounds that have perpendicular sides; in one
case the entrance to the courtyard is by stairways
leading over the roof of one of the enclosing edifices.
The only important exceptions to the usual type of
Yucatan buildings are the circular structures with
conical roofs, at Chichen and Mayapan, and the gigantic
walls composing the so-called gymnasiums at
Chichen and Uxmal.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the strength of these structures
depended to a great extent on the excellence of
the mortar by which the blocks were united, since the
latter are not usually laid so as to break joints, although
carefully placed so that the plummet line
applied to such walls as are uninjured, rarely detects
any departure from perfect regularity. A Maya custom
of inserting projecting stones, or <i>katunes</i>, in the
walls of their buildings as a record of time and in
commemoration of great events is spoken of by many
authors; and by certain stones which he identifies with
the katunes, M. Waldeck computes the age of some
of the ruins, but I am unable to tell which are the
stones meant, unless they be those already mentioned
as elephants' trunks.</p>

<p>Besides the columns mentioned in connection with
doorways, many others are found whose use in most
cases is not understood. They are both round and
square, and usually, if not always, composed of several
pieces placed one upon another. Among them
may be mentioned the row of round columns on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
terrace of the Governor's House at Uxmal, sixteen
columns at Xul from the ruins of Nohcacab, thirty-six
square columns on the summit platform of the pyramid
at Aké, three hundred and eighty short pillars,
also square, arranged round a square at Chichen, eight
round pillars on the terrace of the round house at
Mayapan, the reported line of square columns originally
supporting a gallery at Mérida, and finally the
monoliths of Sijoh, which latter may have been idols.</p>

<p>I now come to the interior and exterior decorations
of the Yucatan buildings. In some apartments, particularly
at Uxmal, the walls and ceilings present only
the plain surface of the hewn blocks of stone. Most,
however, are covered with a coating of fine white
plaster, and in many this plastered surface is wholly
or partially covered with paintings in bright colors.
The paintings are much damaged in every case, but
seem to have been executed with much care and skill.
They are, apparently, never purely ornamental, but
represent some definite objects, oftener than otherwise
human beings in various attitudes and employments,
battles, processions, and dances. In one or two localities,
as at Kewick, a single stone is decorated with
painting, while the rest of the surface is left plain.
Niches in the walls of a room at Chichen, benches
along the sides and ends at Tuloom, and a reported
inner cornice at Zayi vary the usual interior monotony
of the Maya apartments.</p>

<p>Interior sculptured decorations are of comparatively
rare occurrence. A few of the lintels and jambs in
each of the cities are covered with carvings; the steps
leading up to the raised inner room at Kabah, together
with the base of the walls at their sides, are sculptured;
small circles are cut on the walls of the Casa
del Adivino at Uxmal; a tablet of hieroglyphics
stretches over the inner doorways of a corridor at Chichen;
and a sculptured procession covers the wall and
ceiling of a room on the Gymnasium wall at the same
city. Hieroglyphic inscriptions are not very numerous,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
but are apparently identical in character with those we
have seen at Copan. The only instance noted of interior
decoration in stucco is that of the stucco birds
in a room at Kabah, and a few stuccoed columns.</p>

<p>The exterior walls have almost invariably a cornice
extending over the doorways round the whole circumference,
and another near the roof. Several buildings
have one or two additional cornices. Besides the cornices
a very few fronts are plain; most are so below
the lower cornice, but are decorated in their upper
portions, as several are from top to bottom, with a
mass of complicated sculptured designs, of which the
reader has formed a clear idea by the drawings that
have been presented. These ornaments, or the separate
parts of each, are carved on the faces of cubical
or rectangular blocks which are built into the face of
the wall, each carved piece fitting most accurately
into its place as part of a most elaborate whole. Some
parts of the decoration are also joined to the walls by
means of long tenons. In the human faces represented
in profile among the ornamental carvings the flattened
forehead, or contracted facial angle, is the most important
feature noticed, and this is not as strongly marked
as in many other regions of America. Excepting the
phallus, which is prominent in many of the decorations,
and which was probably a religious symbol, no
ornaments of an obscene nature are noticed. Instead
of stone, stucco is employed at Labphak in
exterior decorations, and to a slight extent at Tuloom
also. Over the front wall of some buildings, and from
the centre of the roof of others, rises a lofty wall,
sometimes in peaks, or turrets, apparently intended
only as a basis for ornamentation. At Kabah this
supplementary wall is plain and resembles from a distance
a second story; on the Nunnery at Uxmal the
ornamentation is in stone; but in other cases stucco is
employed. Only one exterior wall, at Chunhuhu, is
plastered; but all the exterior decorations are supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
to have been originally painted, traces of bright
colors still remaining in sheltered positions.<a id="FNanchor_V-106" href="#Footnote_V-106" class="fnanchor">[V-106]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MAYA IDOLS.</p>

<p>The scarcity of idols among the Maya antiquities
must be regarded as extraordinary. The double-headed
animal and the statue of the Old Woman at
Uxmal; the nude figure carved on a long flat stone
and the small statue in two pieces, at Nohpat; the
idol at Zayi reported as in use for a fountain; the
rude unsculptured monoliths of Sijoh; the scattered
and vaguely mentioned idols on the plains of Mayapan;
and the figures in terra cotta collected by Norman
at Campeche, complete the list; and many of
these may have been originally merely decorations for
buildings. That the inhabitants of Yucatan were
idolators there is no possible doubt, and in connection
with the magnificent shrines and temples erected by
them, stone representatives of their deities carved with
all their aboriginal art and rivaling or excelling the
grand obelisks of Copan, might naturally be sought
for. But in view of the facts it must be concluded
that the Maya idols were small, and that such as escaped
the destructive hands of the Spanish ecclesiastics,
were buried by the natives, as the only means of
preventing their desecration. Altars are as rare as
idols; indeed, only at Tuloom are such relics definitely
reported, and then they are of small size and of simple
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
construction, merely hewn blocks on which copal
was burned.</p>

<p>The almost complete lack of pottery, implements,
and weapons is no less remarkable. Earthen relics,
so abundant over nearly the whole surface of the Pacific
States, even in the territory of the wildest tribes,
where no ruined edifices are to be seen, are rarely met
with in Yucatan and Chiapa, where the grandest ruins
indicate the highest civilization. No trace of any
metal has been found in Yucatan, although there is
some historical evidence that copper implements were
used by the Mayas to a slight extent in the sixteenth
century, the material for which must have been brought
from other parts of the country. Besides spear and
arrow heads of flint or obsidian which have been found
in small numbers in different parts of the state, and
the implements included in the Camacho collection at
Campeche already mentioned, there remains to be
noticed "a collection of stone implements, gathered
by Dr. J. W. Veile, in Yucatan," spoken of by Mr Foster
as resembling in many respects similar relics from
the Mississippi Valley. "The material employed is
porphyry. Some of them are less than two inches in
length, and the edges are polished as if from use. At
the first glance it would be said that many of these
implements were too small for practical purposes, but
when we reflect that the material out of which the
ancient inhabitants of that region cut their basso-relievos,
was a soft coralline limestone, I find, by experiment,
that such a tool is almost as effective as one
of steel. Some of the implements, however, are
cylindrical in shape, with the convex surface brought
to an edge, and the opposite side ground out like a
gouge."<a id="FNanchor_V-107" href="#Footnote_V-107" class="fnanchor">[V-107]</a> There can be little doubt that the Maya
sculpture was executed with tools of stone, although
with such implements the complicated carvings on
hard zapote lintels must have presented great difficulties
even to aboriginal patience and skill.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MAYAS AS ARTISTS.</p>

<p>With respect to the artistic merit of the monuments
of Yucatan, and the degree of civilization which they
imply on the behalf of their builders, I leave the
reader to form his own conclusion from the information
which I have collected and presented as clearly as possible
in the preceding pages. That they bear, as a
whole, no favorable comparison with the works of the
ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Assyrians, and
perhaps other old-world peoples must, I believe, be
granted. Yet they are most wonderful when considered
as the handiwork of a people since lapsed into a
condition little above savagism. I append in a note
some quotations designed to show the impression these
monuments have made on explorers and students.<a id="FNanchor_V-108" href="#Footnote_V-108" class="fnanchor">[V-108]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ANTIQUITY OF THE MAYA MONUMENTS.</p>

<p>Finally I have to consider the antiquity of the Yucatan
monuments. As in the case of all ruined cities
and edifices, the questions, when and by whom were
they built? are of the most absorbing interest. In
Yucatan the latter question presents no difficulties,
and the former few, compared with those connected
with other American ruins. It was formerly a favorite
theory that the great American palaces and temples
of ancient times, whose remains have astonished
the modern world, were the work of civilized peoples
that have become extinct, probably of some old-world
people which long centuries ago settled on our coasts
and flourished for a long period, but was at last forced
to succumb to the native races whose descendants
occupied the land at the coming of Europeans in the
sixteenth century. The discussion of the origin of the
American people and of the American civilization, as
well as of the possible agency of old-world elements
in the development of the latter, belongs to another
part of my work; still it may be appropriately stated
here that the theory of extinct civilized races in
America, to which our ruined cities may be attributed,
rests upon only the very vaguest and most unsubstantial
foundation, while so far as the Yucatan cities are
concerned it rests on no foundation at all.</p>

<p>The traditional history of the peninsula, which will
be given in the following volume, represents Yucatan
as constituting the mighty Maya empire, whose rulers,
secular and religious, reared magnificent cities, palaces,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
and temples, and which flourished in great, if not its
greatest, power down to within a little more than a
century of the Spaniards' coming. Then the empire
was more or less broken up by civil wars, an era of
dissension and comparative weakness ensued, some of
the great cities were abandoned in ruins, but the edifices
of most, and especially the temples, were still
occupied by the disunited factions of the original empire.
In this condition the Spaniards found and conquered
the Maya people. They found the immense
stone pyramids and buildings of most of the cities
still used by the natives for religious services, although
not for dwellings, as they had probably never been so
used even by their builders. The conquerors established
their own towns generally in the immediate
vicinity of the aboriginal cities, procuring all the
building material they needed from the native structures,
destroying so far as possible all the idols, altars,
and other paraphernalia of the Maya worship, and
forcing the discontinuance of all ceremonies in honor
of the heathen gods. A few cities escaped the damning
blight of European towns in their vicinity, and
kept up their rites in secret for some years later; such
were Uxmal, Tuloom, and probably others of the best
preserved ruins. All the early voyagers, conquistadores,
and writers speak of the wonderful stone edifices
found by them in the country, partly abandoned
and partly occupied by the natives. To suppose that
the buildings they saw and described were not identical
with the ruins that have been described in these
pages, that every trace of the former has disappeared,
and that the latter entirely escaped the notice of the
early visitors to Yucatan, is too absurd to deserve a
moment's consideration. That the Mayas were found
worshiping in the temples of an extinct race is a position
almost equally untenable. The Spaniards forced
the Mayas to accept a new faith, utterly crushed out
their ancient spirit by a long course of oppression, and
then together with other Europeans resorted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
theory of an extinct old-world race to account for the
wonderful structures which the ancestors of the degraded
Mayas could not have reared. The Mayas are
not, however, the only illustrations of a deteriorated
race to be seen in Yucatan, as will be understood by
comparing the present Spanish population of the
peninsula with the proud Castilian conquerors of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Mr Stephens, to whom many of the Spanish and
Maya documents relating to Yucatan history were
unknown, sought carefully for proofs in support of his
belief that the cities were constructed by "the same
races who inhabited the country at the time of the
Spanish conquest, or by some not very distant progenitors."
He was entirely successful in establishing the
truth of his position, which rested on the statements
of the historians with whose works he was acquainted,
and on the following points, many of them discovered
by himself, and whose only weakness is the fact that
they were not really needed to justify his conclusions.
1st. The Maya arch in the foundations of the Franciscan
convent at Mérida, built in 1547, with the historical
statement that Mérida was built on the mounds
of ancient Tihoo. 2d. The traditional destruction of
Mayapan in 1420. 3d. The custom of the Spaniards
to locate their towns near those of the natives, together
with the almost uniform location of the ruins,
near the modern towns. 4th. The skeletons and
skulls dug up at Ticul were pronounced by Dr Morton
to belong to the universal American type. 5th.
Sr Peon's deed to the Uxmal estate, dated in 1673,
states that the natives still worshiped in the stone
buildings; that a native then claimed the estate as
having belonged to his ancestors; that at that time
there were doors in the ruins which were opened and
shut; and that water was then drawn from the aguadas.
6th. The sword in the hands of the kneeling
sculptured figure at Kabah, which has already been
mentioned as almost identical with an aboriginal Maya
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
weapon. 7th. A map dated 1557 was found at Mani,
on which Uxmal is designated by a different character
from all the other surrounding towns, being the only
one that is not surmounted by a cross. 8th. With the
map was found a document in the Maya language, also
dated 1557, announcing the arrival of certain officials
with interpreters at, and their departure from, Uxmal.
Now there never was a Spanish town of Uxmal, and
the hacienda was not established until one hundred
and forty-five years later. 9th. The gymnasiums at
Chichen and Uxmal, agreeing with those traditionally
described in connection with certain aboriginal games
of ball. 10th. Many scattered resemblances to Aztec
relics and customs. 11th. The European penknife
discovered in a grave with aboriginal relics at Kantunile.
12th. The comparatively fresh appearance of
the altars and other relics at Tuloom.<a id="FNanchor_V-109" href="#Footnote_V-109" class="fnanchor">[V-109]</a></p>

<p>It may then be accepted as a fact susceptible of no
doubt that the Yucatan structures were built by the
Mayas, the direct ancestors of the people found in the
peninsula at the conquest and of the present native
population. Respecting their age we only know the
date of their abandonment&mdash;that is the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. Nothing in the ruins themselves
gives any clue to the date of their construction, and
this is not the place to discuss the few vague historical
traditions bearing on the subject. The data on which
different writers have based their speculations, and
claimed for these monuments greater or less antiquity
are the following. 1st. The immense trees that are
found growing on the ruins, and the accumulation of
soil and vegetable matter on the roofs and terrace
platforms; but to persons acquainted with the rapid
growth of trees in tropical countries, these constitute
no evidence of antiquity. 2d. The ignorance of the
natives respecting the builders of the monuments;
the investigations of Indian character in the preceding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
volumes of this work, however, show conclusively
enough that two generations, to say nothing
of three centuries, are amply sufficient to blot from
the native mind everything definite concerning the
past. 3d. Comparisons of the Yucatan ruins with
different old-world remains; the argument being that
if an American monument is more dilapidated than
an Egyptian one, it must be older. 4th. And on the
other hand, against a great antiquity, the destructiveness
of the tropical vegetation and tropical rains. 5th.
The softness of the building material. 6th. The perfect
preservation in many places of wood and paint.
7th. The rapid decay of the ruins between the periods
of the earliest and latest visits.</p>

<p>It will be at once noted that the preceding points
all bear on the date of abandonment and not at all on
the date of construction. Explorers may marvel,
according to the view they take of the matter, either
that the buildings have resisted for three or four hundred
years the destructive agencies to which they have
been exposed; or, that three or four short centuries
have wrought so great ravages in structures so strongly
built; still the fact remains that the buildings were
abandoned three or four hundred years ago. M. Waldeck's
theory, by which he computes the antiquity of
some of the ruins by certain stones peculiarly placed in
the walls, or by the small houses&mdash;<i>calli</i>, or house, being
one of the signs of the Aztec calendar&mdash;over the doorways
of the Nunnery at Uxmal, like Mr Jones' argument
that the structures must have been reared before
the invention of the arch, is mere idle speculation,
utterly unfounded in fact or probability. The history
of the Mayas indicates the building of some of the
cities at various dates from the third to the tenth centuries.
As I have said before, there is nothing in the
buildings to indicate the date of their erection,&mdash;that
they were or were not standing at the commencement
of the Christian Era. We may see how, abandoned
and uncared for, they have resisted the ravages of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
elements for three or four centuries. How many centuries
they may have stood guarded and kept in
repair by the builders and their descendants we can
only conjecture.<a id="FNanchor_V-110" href="#Footnote_V-110" class="fnanchor">[V-110]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NO RELICS IN TABASCO.</p>

<p>The next step, as antiquarian investigation is
pushed westward along the continental line, will
lead us from the boundaries of Guatemala and Yucatan
to the isthmus of Tehuantepec. The included
territory, constituting the geographical basis of the
present chapter, stretches on the Atlantic shore from
the Laguna de Terminos to Laguna de Santa Ana,
about one hundred and fifty miles, and on the Pacific
a somewhat less distance from the bar of Ayutla to
the bar of Tonalá The northern and smaller portion&mdash;all
in the low and flat tierra caliente&mdash;is comprised
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
in the state of Tabasco, with a part of El Carmen, a
province belonging politically, I believe, to Yucatan;
while in the south&mdash;a high and mountainous region,
except a very narrow strip along the Pacific border&mdash;we
have the state of Chiapas, with its south-eastern
province of Soconusco, to the political possession of
which Guatemala, no less than her neighbor, has
always laid claim. Tabasco and Chiapas, like Yucatan,
are states of the Mexican Republic, although
they are situated in what it is more convenient to
term Central America, and in a region treated in a
preceding volume of this work as a part of the Maya
territory. This chapter will consequently complete
the description of southern, or Maya, antiquities, and
bring us to the study of Nahua monuments in the
north.</p>

<p>Tabasco, a part of the aboriginal Anáhuac Xicalanco,
extends inland seventy-five miles on an average
throughout its whole length. It is for the most part
a low marshy plain&mdash;the American tierra caliente par
excellence&mdash;of the usual tropical fertility, covered
with an exuberant growth, but extremely unhealthy
to all but natives, except while the winter winds
render the navigation of the coast waters dangerous.
This tract is traversed by two large rivers, flowing
from the hilly country farther inland, the Tabasco
and Usumacinta, under several different names, communicating
with each other by many branches, and
pouring, or rather creeping, into the gulf through
many mouths. In the annual season of inundation
from June to October, the whole country is involved
in a labyrinth of streams and sloughs, and travel by
land becomes impossible. The luxuriant tropical
vegetation includes a variety of valuable dye-woods,
the export of which constitutes the leading industry
of the few towns located on the banks of the larger
streams. On the immediate coast some large towns
and temples were seen by the early voyagers, but I
have no information that relics of any kind have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
discovered in modern times. It is true that no careful
explorations have been made, but the character of
the country is not promising, so far as ruined cities
and other architectural monuments are concerned.
Indeed, it is not improbable that a large part of this
region was covered by a body of water similar to the
Laguna de Terminos, at a time when the great aboriginal
Central American cities, now far inland, were
founded. Moreover, as state boundaries are not very
accurately laid down in the maps, and as the location
of relics by travelers is in many cases vague, it is
quite possible that some of the few miscellaneous
monuments which I shall describe in this chapter,
are really within the limits of Tabasco instead of
Chiapas.</p>

<p>As we go southward from the gulf coast, and reach
the boundary of Chiapas the face of the country changes
rapidly from marshy flat to undulating hills of gradually
increasing height toward the Pacific, retaining
all the wonderful fertility and density of tropical forest
growth without the pestilential malaria and oppressive
heat of the plain below. Here is an earthly
paradise, the charms of which have been enjoyed with
enthusiastic delight by the few lovers of nature who
have penetrated its solitudes.<a id="FNanchor_VI-1" href="#Footnote_VI-1" class="fnanchor">[VI-1]</a></p>

<p>The natural advantages of this region seem to have
been fully appreciated by aboriginal Americans, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
here they reared the temples and palaces of one of
their grandest cities, or religious centres, which as a
ruin under the name of Palenque has become famous
throughout the world, as it was doubtless throughout
America in the days of its pristine glory many centuries
ago. Built on the heights just mentioned, which
may be appropriately termed foothills of the lofty
sierras beyond, its high places afforded a broad view
over the forest-covered plain below to the waters of
the gulf. A detailed account of the explorations by
which the ruins of this city have been brought to
light, and of the numerous books and reports resulting
from such explorations, is given in the appended note.<a id="FNanchor_VI-2" href="#Footnote_VI-2" class="fnanchor">[VI-2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
About the year 1564 a Dominican missionary, with
a few Tzendal natives who had been converted to
the true faith by his labors in their behalf, chose what
he deemed a suitable location for future evangelical
efforts, and founded the little town of Santo Domingo
del Palenque, some seventy miles north-east of San
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Cristóval, the state capital, on a tributary of the Usumacinta,
not over twenty miles, perhaps less, from the
head of navigation for canoes. Nearly two centuries
later a group of magnificent ruins, whose existence
had been before utterly unknown, at least to any but
natives, was accidentally discovered only a few leagues
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
from the town in the midst of a dense forest. Since
their discovery in the middle of the eighteenth century
the ruins have been several times carefully explored
both by public and private enterprise, and all
their prominent features have been clearly brought to
the knowledge of the world by means of illustrative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
plates and descriptive text. Waldeck and Stephens
are the best and most complete authorities, but the
reports of Antonio del Rio, Guillaume Dupaix, Juan
Galindo, and Désiré Charnay afford also much valuable
information, especially in connection with the two
standard authorities mentioned. After a most careful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
study of all that has been written on the subject,
I shall endeavor to give the reader a clear idea of
ruined structures which have given rise to more faithful
investigation and absurd speculation than any
others on the continent.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NAME OF THE ANCIENT CITY.</p>

<p>The aboriginal name of the city represented by this
group of ruins is absolutely unknown. Palenque, the
name by which it is known, is, as we have seen, simply
that of a modern village near by. The word <i>palenque</i>
is of Spanish origin and means a stockade or
enclosure of palisades. How it came to be applied to
the village of Santo Domingo is not explained, but
there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it has
any connection with the ruins.<a id="FNanchor_VI-3" href="#Footnote_VI-3" class="fnanchor">[VI-3]</a> Sr Ordoñez, already
mentioned, applies in his unpublished writings the
name Nachan, 'city of the Serpents,' the same as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Aztec Culhuacan, to Palenque, but so far as can be
known, without any authority whatever. This name
has been adopted without question by several writers,
and it is quite common to read of "the ruins of Culhuacan,
improperly termed Palenque."<a id="FNanchor_VI-4" href="#Footnote_VI-4" class="fnanchor">[VI-4]</a> The old traditions
of the primitive times when Votan's great
empire flourished, apply the name Xibalba not only
to the empire but to a great city which was its capital.
Palenque, as the greatest city of ancient times
in this region which has left traces of its existence,
may have been identical with Xibalba; the difficulty
of disproving the identity is equaled only by that of
proving it.<a id="FNanchor_VI-5" href="#Footnote_VI-5" class="fnanchor">[VI-5]</a> The natives, here as elsewhere, have
often applied to the city a name which simply indicates
its ruined condition, calling it Otolum, 'place of
falling stones,' a name also borne by the small stream
on which the buildings stand. Waldeck writes it
Ototiun, 'stone house,' which he derives from the native
words <i>otote</i> and <i>tinnich</i>. Stephens calls the stream
Otula. If there were any good reasons for abandoning
the designation Palenque, and there certainly are
none, Otolum would perhaps be the most appropriate
name to take its place.<a id="FNanchor_VI-6" href="#Footnote_VI-6" class="fnanchor">[VI-6]</a> The name Xhembobel-Moyos,
from that of another modern village of this region,
seems sometimes to have been used by the natives in
connection with Palenque; and in a Tzendal manuscript
the name Ghocan, 'sculptured serpent,' is said to
be used in the same connection; while one author, drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
heavily on his imagination, speaks of the "immense
city of Culhuacan or Huehuetlapallan," thus
identifying Palenque with the famous city whence the
Toltecs started in their traditional migration to Anáhuac.<a id="FNanchor_VI-7" href="#Footnote_VI-7" class="fnanchor">[VI-7]</a>
By the Spanish inhabitants and most of the
native population of Santo Domingo, the ruins are
commonly spoken of as the Casas de Piedra.</p>

<p class="sidenote">LOCATION OF THE RUINS.</p>

<p>The structures that have attracted the attention of
and been described by all the successive explorers,
are generally the same, and in their descriptions less
exaggeration is found in the earlier reports than
might naturally be expected. In extent, however,
the city has gradually dwindled in the successive
reports from two hundred buildings stretching over a
space of twenty miles, to less than the area of a
modern town of humble pretensions. A few scattered
mounds or fragments in the surrounding country,
which very probably exist, but which have
escaped the attention of modern travelers, eager to
investigate the more wonderful central structures,
are probably the only basis of the statements by the
first explorers. The earlier visitors doubtless counted
each isolated fragment of hewn stone, or other trace
of the antiguos' work, as representing an aboriginal
edifice.<a id="FNanchor_VI-8" href="#Footnote_VI-8" class="fnanchor">[VI-8]</a> Doubtless the condition of Palenque has
changed materially for the worse since its discovery.
The rapidity with which structures of solid stone are
destroyed by the growth of a tropical forest, when
once the roots have gained a hold, is noted with surprise
by every traveler. In the work of destruction,
moreover, nature has not been unaided by man, and
few visitors have been content to depart without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
some relic broken from the walls. Del Rio, if we
may credit his own words, seems to have attempted a
wholesale destruction of the city; he says: "By
dint of perseverance I effected all that was necessary
to be done, so that ultimately there remained neither
a window nor a doorway blocked up, a partition that
was not thrown down, nor a room, corridor, court,
tower, nor subterranean passage in which excavations
were not effected from two to three varas in depth."<a id="FNanchor_VI-9" href="#Footnote_VI-9" class="fnanchor">[VI-9]</a></p>

<p>Palenque,&mdash;for I shall hereafter apply this name
exclusively to the ruins,&mdash;is situated about six or
seven miles<a id="FNanchor_VI-10" href="#Footnote_VI-10" class="fnanchor">[VI-10]</a> south-west of Santo Domingo, and some
sixty-five miles north-east of San Cristóval. The
topography of the region is not definitely marked
out on the maps, and the nomenclature of the streams
and mountains is hopelessly confused; but many parallel
streams flow north-westward from the hills, and
unite to form a branch of the Usumacinta sometimes
called the Tulija. The Otolum on which the ruins
stand seems to be a tributary from the north of one
of the parallel streams. The location is consequently
in a small valley high in the foothills, through which
runs a mountain stream of small size during the dry
season, but becoming a torrent when swollen by the
rains.<a id="FNanchor_VI-11" href="#Footnote_VI-11" class="fnanchor">[VI-11]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>The present extent of the ruins, their distribution,
and their relative size are shown in the accompanying
plan, taken with slight changes to be mentioned in
their proper place, from Waldeck.<a id="FNanchor_VI-12" href="#Footnote_VI-12" class="fnanchor">[VI-12]</a> The structures
that have been described or definitely located by any
author are numbered on the plan, the unnumbered
ones being heaps of ruins whose existence is mentioned
by all, and the exact location of which M. Waldeck
in his long stay was able to fix. It will be seen that
the buildings all face the cardinal points with a very
slight variation. So thick is the forest on the site and
over the very buildings that no one of the latter can
be seen from its neighbor or from the adjoining hills.
M. Morelet, on one occasion, lost his bearings in the
immediate vicinity, and although he did not perhaps
go a half-mile from the ruins, yet he had the greatest
difficulty in returning, and coming from a contrary
direction thought at first he had discovered new monuments
of antiquity. When the trees are cut down,
as they have been several times, only a few years are
necessary to restore the forest to its original density,
and each explorer has to begin anew the work of
clearing.<a id="FNanchor_VI-13" href="#Footnote_VI-13" class="fnanchor">[VI-13]</a></p>

<p>I begin with the largest of the structures, marked
1 on the plan, and commonly known as the Palace,
although of course nothing is known of its original
use. From a narrow level on the left bank of the
stream rises an artificial elevation of pyramidal form,
with quadrangular base measuring about two hundred
and sixty by three hundred and ten feet, and something
over forty feet in height, with sloping sides
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
and traces of broad central stairways on the east
and north.<a id="FNanchor_VI-14" href="#Footnote_VI-14" class="fnanchor">[VI-14]</a> The sides were faced with regular
blocks of hewn stone, but this facing has been so
broken up and forced out of place by the roots of
trees that the original outline is hardly distinguishable.
Dupaix, both in text and drawings, divides the
pyramid into three sections or stories by two projections
of a few feet running horizontally round the
sides; he puts a similar projection, or cornice, at the
summit, and covers the whole surface of the sides
with a polished coating of cement. That this state
of things existed at the time of his exploration is possible,
although not very probable; yet it is not unlikely
that the slopes were originally covered with
plaster, or even painted.</p>

<p class="caption">Mode of constructing Pyramid.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURES.</p>

<p>The material of which the bulk of the mound is
composed is not very definitely stated by any visitor.
I believe, however, that I have discovered a peculiarity
in the construction of this pyramid, which
may possibly throw some light on the origin of the
pyramidal structure so universal among the civilized
nations of the continent. I think that, perhaps with
a view to raise this palace or temple above the waters
of the stream, four thick walls, possibly more, were
built up perpendicularly from the ground to the desired
height; then, after the completion of the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
to strengthen them, or during the progress of the
work to facilitate the raising of the stones, the interior
was filled with earth, and the exterior graded
with the same material, the whole being subsequently
faced with hewn stone. My reasons for this opinion
may be illustrated by the annexed cut. All the
authorities by text and plates represent the pyramid
with sloping stone-faced sides, much damaged by the
trees. Two of them, Stephens and Waldeck, making
excavations from the summit at different points,
clearly imply that the interior, D, is of earth. The
height is given by all the visitors down to Stephens, as
from forty to sixty feet. Now Charnay, coming nearly
twenty years later, found the eastern side a perpendicular
wall, only fifteen feet high, and proves the accuracy
of his statement by his photograph, which, as
he says, cannot lie. I cannot satisfactorily account for
the condition of the structure as found by him, except
by supposing that the stone facing, loosened by the
trees, had fallen from B to F, and that the earth
which filled the sides at EE, had been washed away
by the rain, leaving the perpendicular wall at B.
We shall see later that it is utterly impossible to fix
any definite date for the founding of Palenque; but
it is doubtless to be referred to the earliest period of
American civilization which has left definite architectural
traces; and its claims are perhaps as strong
as those of any other to be considered the oldest
American city. If this pyramid was the first erected
and took its shape as above indicated, its adoption as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
a type throughout the region penetrated by the religion
and civilization of its builders, would be very
natural, although the form would afterwards be more
readily attained by means of a solid structure. I
offer this as a conjectural theory to take its place by
the side of many others on the subject, and at the
least not more devoid of foundation than several of
its companions.<a id="FNanchor_VI-15" href="#Footnote_VI-15" class="fnanchor">[VI-15]</a> It is not improbable that the
builders may have taken advantage of a slight natural
elevation as a foundation for their work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">EXTERIOR OF THE PALACE.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BAS-RELIEFS OF THE PALACE.</p>

<p>The summit platform of the pyramid supports the
Palace, which covers its whole extent save a narrow
passage round the edge, and the exterior dimensions
of which are about one hundred and eighty by two
hundred and twenty-eight feet and thirty feet high.<a id="FNanchor_VI-16" href="#Footnote_VI-16" class="fnanchor">[VI-16]</a>
The outer wall, a large portion of which has fallen,
was pierced with about forty doorways, which were
generally wider than the portions of the wall that
separated them, giving the whole the appearance of a
portico with wide piers. The doorways are eight and
a half feet high and nine feet wide. The tops seem
to have been originally flat, but the lintels have in
every case fallen and disappeared, having been perhaps
of wood; indeed, Charnay claims to have found
the marks of one of these wooden lintels composed of
two pieces, while Del Rio found a plain rectangular
block of stone five by six feet, extending from one of
the piers to another. The whole exterior was covered
with a coat of hard plaster, and there are some traces
of a projecting cornice which surrounded the building
above the doorways, pierced at regular intervals with
small circular holes, such as I have noticed in Yucatan,
conjectured with much reason to have originally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
held poles which supported a kind of awning. Later
visitors have found no part of the roof remaining in
place; but Castañeda, who may have found some portion
standing, represents it as sloping, plain, and plastered.
From the interior construction and from the
roofs of other Palenque buildings, it is probable that
his drawing gives a correct idea of the Palace in this
respect. Dupaix often speaks of the roofs at Palenque
as being covered with large stone flags (lajas)
carefully joined; other authors are silent respecting
the arrangement of the stones in the roofs. Judging
from the position of the grand stairway that leads up
the side of the pyramid, and from the arrangement
of the interior doorways, the chief entrance, or front,
of the Palace, was on the east, towards the stream.
It is from this side, although not so well preserved as
some other portions, that general views have been
taken.<a id="FNanchor_VI-17" href="#Footnote_VI-17" class="fnanchor">[VI-17]</a> Of the piers that separated the doorways in
this outer wall, only fifteen have been found standing,
eight on the east and seven on the west, although
their foundations may be readily traced throughout
nearly the whole circumference. Each of the remaining
piers, and probably of all in their original condition,
contained on its external surface a bas-relief in
stucco, and these reliefs with their borders occupied
the whole space between the doorways. The cuts, fig.
1, 2, and 3, represent three of the best preserved of the
reliefs, drawings of six only of them having been published.
Most of the designs, like those shown in the
cuts, were of human figures in various attitudes, and
having a variety of dress, ornaments, and insignia. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
will be noticed that the faces are all in profile, and the
foreheads invariably flattened. This cranial form was
doubtless the highest type of beauty or nobility in the
eyes of the ancient artists; and of course the natural
inference is that it was artificially produced by methods
similar to those employed by the Mayas of more
modern times. Yet many have believed that the
builders of Palenque or the priests and leaders that
directed the work were of a now extinct race, the
peculiar natural conformation of whose forehead was
artificially imitated by the descendants of their disciples.
The many far-fetched explanations of these
strange figures, which fertile imaginations have devised,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
would not, I believe, be instructive to the
reader, who will derive more amusement and profit
from his own conjectures. The resemblance of the
head-dress in fig. 2 to an elephant's trunk is, however,
somewhat striking. We may be very sure that these
figures placed in so prominent a position on the exterior
walls of the grandest edifice in the city, were not
merely ornamental and without significance; and it is
almost equally certain that the three hieroglyphic
signs over the top of each group would, if they could
be read, explain their meaning. Some of the piers
seem to have been covered entirely with hieroglyphics
in stucco, but better preserved specimens of these inscriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
will be shown in connection with other buildings
at Palenque. The stucco, or cement, from which
the figures are molded, is the same as that with which
the whole building was covered, and is nearly as hard
as the stone itself. M. Charnay found evidence to convince
him that the reliefs were put on after the regular
coating of cement had become hardened; Dupaix
believes that some of them were molded over a skeleton
of small stones, in the same way perhaps as the
gigantic faces at Izamal in Yucatan. Traces of color
in sheltered portions make it evident that the piers
were originally painted.<a id="FNanchor_VI-18" href="#Footnote_VI-18" class="fnanchor">[VI-18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PLAN OF THE PALACE.</p>

<p>Nothing further remains to be said of the exterior of
the Palace; let us therefore enter the doorway at the
head of the eastern stairway. The main building is
found to consist of two corridors, formed by three
parallel walls and covered by one roof, which extend
entirely round the circumference of the platform, and
enclose a quadrangular court measuring about one
hundred and fifty by two hundred feet. This court
also contains five or six buildings, some of them connected
with the main edifice, others separate, which
divide the court into four smaller ones. The whole
arrangement of buildings and courts is clearly shown
in the preceding ground plan. At <i>b</i>, is the chief
entrance at the head of the eastern stairway; <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
etc., are the standing piers with stucco bas-reliefs,
which have been noticed already; A, A, B, B, etc., are
the main corridors; C, D, E, F, G, the smaller enclosed
buildings; 1, 2, 3, 4, the courts.<a id="FNanchor_VI-19" href="#Footnote_VI-19" class="fnanchor">[VI-19]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE PALACE CORRIDORS.</p>

<p>Entering at <i>b</i>, we find that the corridors extend
uninterruptedly on the east and north, but are divided
on the other sides, especially on the south, into
compartments. In the inner as in the outer wall
doorways are frequent, while the central wall has but
few. The corridors are each nine feet wide and
twenty feet high, the perpendicular walls being ten
feet, and the sides of the ceiling inclining inward
from that height until they nearly form an acute
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
angle at the top. The cut represents a section of
the two corridors in nearly their true proportions.
The walls are from two to three feet thick, and so far
as can be determined from the authorities, they are
built entirely of hewn blocks of stone, without the
interior filling of rubble which I have noticed in the
Yucatan ruins. Indeed, with a thickness of three
feet or less the use of rubble would have been almost
impracticable. Floor, walls, and ceiling are covered
with a coating of the same hard cement found on the
exterior walls. The cut on the following page is a
view from a point somewhat southward from <i>b</i>, and
looking northward into the corridor; it gives an excellent
idea of the present appearance of this portion
of the Palace. The construction of the ceiling, both
in the Palace and in other Palenque structures, is by
means of the triangular arch of overlapping stones,
as in Yucatan. A remarkable difference, however, is
that the projecting corners of the blocks, instead of
being beveled so as to leave a smooth stone surface,
are left, and the smooth surface is obtained by filling
the notches with cement.</p>

<p>The doorway through the central wall at <i>c</i>, is
eighteen feet high, and its top, instead of being flat
like those in the outer wall, takes the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
trefoil arch; depressions, or niches, of the same
trefoil form, extend at regular intervals right and
left from the doorway along the inclined face of the
ceiling. The last cut gives a clear idea of the doorway
and trefoil niches, but the artist who copied it
from Catherwood's plate for <i>Morelet's Travels</i>, from
which I take it, has erred in representing the niches
as continuing downward on the perpendicular wall.
Near the top of the perpendicular wall was a line
of what seem to have been circular stucco medallions,
perhaps portraits, at <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, of the plan,
which have for the most part fallen. Small circular
holes, apparently left by the decay of beams that
once stretched across the arch, occur at regular intervals
between the niches of the ceiling. The cut
shows a front elevation of the corridor from <i>e</i> of the
plan looking eastward, and includes all the peculiarities
found in any part of the corridors. The position
of the medallions is shown, though they are
really on the opposite side of the wall, and the
shaded figures on the left of the cut are introduced
from other parts of the Palace, to illustrate the different
forms of niches which occur in the walls. The
niches on the right are in their proper place. The
three which are symmetrically placed at each side of
this and some other doorways, are from eight to ten
inches square, and have a cylinder two inches in
diameter fixed upright within each. They would
seem to have served in some way to support the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
doors. The <img src="images/t-30.jpg" width="11" height="10" alt="T" /> shaped niches are of very frequent
occurrence throughout the ruins, and have caused
much speculation by reason of their resemblance to
the Egyptian <i>tau</i> and to the cross. Some of them
extend quite through the walls, and served probably
for ventilation and the admission of light. Others of
the same shape are of varying depths and of unknown
use; they may have been niches for the reception of
small idols, or possibly designed to hold the torches
which lit up the corridors, since M. Waldeck claims
to have found the marks of lamp-black on the tops of
some of them.<a id="FNanchor_VI-20" href="#Footnote_VI-20" class="fnanchor">[VI-20]</a> Nothing remains to be said of the
corridors of the main building, save that the interior

<p class="sidenote">COURT OF THE PALACE.</p>

<p>Passing through the doorway <i>e</i> we enter the court 1,
the dimensions of which are about seventy by eighty
feet, its pavement, like that of the other courts, being
eight or ten feet below that of the corridors. This pavement
is covered to a depth of several feet with débris,
which has never been entirely cleared away by any
explorer. The court is bounded on the north and east
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
by the walls, or piers, of the inner corridor, and on
the south and west by those of the interior buildings
C and D. The piers, whose position and number are
clearly indicated on the plan, are, except those on the
north, yet standing, and each has its stucco bas-relief
as on the eastern front. These reliefs are, however,
much damaged, and no drawings of them have been
made, or, at least, published. Broad stairways of
five or six steps lead down to the level of the court
pavement, at <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, and a narrow stairway, <i>h</i>,
affords access through an end door to the building E.<a id="FNanchor_VI-22" href="#Footnote_VI-22" class="fnanchor">[VI-22]</a></p>

<p>The eastern stairway is thirty feet wide, and on
each side of it, at <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, on a surface about fifteen feet
long by eleven feet high, formed by immense stone
slabs inclined at about the same angle as the stairway
itself, is sculptured in low relief a group of human
figures in peculiar attitudes. The northern group is
shown in the accompanying cut. Stephens pronounces
the attitude of the figures one of pain and trouble.
"The design and anatomical proportions of the figures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
are faulty, but there is a force of expression about
them which shows the skill and conceptive power of
the artist."<a id="FNanchor_VI-23" href="#Footnote_VI-23" class="fnanchor">[VI-23]</a> Stephens' plate of this side of the court
shows remains of stucco ornamentation and also a line
of small circular holes over the doorways of the inner
corridor. The opposite or western stairway is narrower
than the eastern, and at its sides, at <i>j, j</i>, are
two colossal human figures sculptured in a hard whitish
stone, as shown in the cut, in which, however, the
stairway is shown somewhat narrower than its true
proportions. Waldeck sees in these figures a male and
female whose features are of the Caucasian type. At
the sides of the stairway, at <i>k, k, k</i>, stand three figures
of smaller dimensions, sculptured on pilasters
which occur at regular intervals. On the basement
wall between the pilasters are found small squares of
hieroglyphics.<a id="FNanchor_VI-24" href="#Footnote_VI-24" class="fnanchor">[VI-24]</a> In the centre of the court Waldeck
found some traces of a circular basin.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COURTS OF THE PALACE.</p>

<p>The western court, 2, measuring about thirty by
eighty feet, has a narrow stairway of three steps at <i>l</i>,
leading up to the central building C. At the ends of
this stairway, at <i>o</i>, <i>o</i>, are two large blocks similar in
position to those at <i>j</i>, <i>j</i>, but their sloping fronts bear
no sculptured figures. As in the other court, however,
there are some squares of hieroglyphics on the
basement walls. The piers round this court, such as
remain standing, bear each a stucco bas-relief.<a id="FNanchor_VI-25" href="#Footnote_VI-25" class="fnanchor">[VI-25]</a></p>

<p>In the southern court, 3, stands the structure known
as the Tower, marked G on the plan. Its base is
about thirty feet square, and rests like the other buildings
on the platform of the pyramid some eight or
ten feet above the pavement of the courts. This base
is solid, but has niches, or false doorways, on the sides.
Above the base two slightly receding stories are still
standing, with portions of a third, each with a doorway&mdash;whose
lintel has fallen&mdash;in the centre of each side,
and surrounded by two plain cornices. The walls are
plain and plastered. The whole structure is of solid
masonry, and the fact that large trees have grown
from the top, presenting a broad surface to the winter
winds, which have not been able to overturn the
Tower, shows the remarkable strength of its construction.
The height of the standing portion is about
fifty feet above the platform of the pyramid. Respecting
the interior arrangement of the Tower, I am
unable to form a clear idea from the descriptions and
drawings of the different visitors, notwithstanding the
fact that Waldeck gives an elevation, section, and
ground plan of each story. Stephens describes the
structure as consisting of a smaller tower within the
larger, and a very narrow staircase leading up from story
to story. Waldeck deemed the Tower a chef d'&oelig;uvre,
while to Stephens' eyes it appeared unsatisfactory and
uninteresting. Dupaix, without doubt erroneously,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
represents the doors as surmounted by regular arches
with keystones.<a id="FNanchor_VI-26" href="#Footnote_VI-26" class="fnanchor">[VI-26]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the other interior buildings of the Palace,
the construction of which is precisely the same
as that of the main corridors, very little remains to
be said, especially since their location and division
into apartments are shown clearly in the plan. According
to Waldeck, the central room of the building
D had traces of rich ornamentation in stucco on its
walls; and he also claims to have found here an
acoustic tube of terra cotta, the mouth of which was
concealed by an ornament of the same material, but
of this extraordinary relic he gives no description.
Stephens found in one of the holes in the ceiling the
worm-eaten remains of a wooden pole, about a foot
in length, the only piece of wood found in Palenque,
and very likely not a part of the original building at
all. Except this chamber, the building is mostly in
ruins, although, as we have seen, the northern piers
remain standing.<a id="FNanchor_VI-27" href="#Footnote_VI-27" class="fnanchor">[VI-27]</a></p>

<p>The roofs of some of the interior buildings seem
to have been somewhat better preserved than those
of the main corridors, so that the sloping roof, double
cornice, and remains of stucco ornamentation were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
observable. In the western apartment of the building
C, the walls have several, in one place as many as
six, distinct coatings of plaster, each hardened and
painted before the next was applied. There was also
noticed a line of what appeared to be written characters
in black, covered by a thin translucent coating.<a id="FNanchor_VI-28" href="#Footnote_VI-28" class="fnanchor">[VI-28]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SCULPTURED TABLET.</p>

<p>The building E has the interior walls of its two
northern apartments decorated with painted and
stucco figures in a very mutilated condition. In the
wall of one of them, at the point <i>p</i>, is fixed an elliptical
stone tablet, three feet wide and four feet
high, the surface of which is covered by the sculptured
device shown in the cut. With the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
of the figures in the court 1, already mentioned, this
is the only instance of stone-carving in the Palace.
It is cut in low relief, and is surrounded by an ornamental
border of stucco. A table consisting of a
plain rectangular stone slab resting on four blocks
which served as legs, stood formerly on the pavement
immediately under the sculptured tablet. Tables of
varying dimensions, but of like construction, were
found in several apartments of the Palace and its
subterranean galleries, as shown in the plan at v, v, v.
They are called tables, beds, or altars, by different
writers. Waldeck says that this one was of green
jasper; and Del Rio, that its edges and legs were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
sculptured, one of the latter having been carried
away by him and sent to Spain. The first cut which
I have given is taken from Waldeck's drawing. The
second cut, representing a portion of the same
tablet, taken from Catherwood's plate, for <i>Morelet's
Travels</i>, differs slightly in some respects&mdash;notably
in the ornament suspended from the neck, represented
by one artist as a face, and by the other as a
cross. Of the subject Mr Stephens says: "The
principal figure sits cross-legged on a couch ornamented
with two leopards' heads; the attitude is
easy, the physiognomy the same as that of the other
personages, and the expression calm and benevolent.
The figure wears around its neck a necklace of pearls,
to which is suspended a small medallion containing a
face; perhaps intended as an image of the sun. Like
every other subject of sculpture we had seen in the
country, the personage had earrings, bracelets on the
wrists, and a girdle round the loins. The head-dress
differs from most of the others at Palenque
in that it wants the plumes of feathers.... The other
figure, which seems that of a woman, is sitting cross-legged
on the ground, richly dressed, and apparently
in the act of making an offering. In this supposed
offering is seen a plume of feathers, in which
the headdress of the principal person is deficient."
Waldeck deems the left-hand figure to be black, and
recognizes in the profile an Ethiopian type. Del Rio
sees in the subject homage paid to a river god; and
Galindo believes the object offered to be a human
head. Somebody imagines that the two animal heads
are those of the seal.<a id="FNanchor_VI-29" href="#Footnote_VI-29" class="fnanchor">[VI-29]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>The stucco ornaments on the walls of the building
F seem to have been richer and more numerous than
elsewhere, but were found in a very dilapidated condition.
In the room <i>q</i>, Stephens found traces of a
stone tablet in the wall, and he also gives a sketch of
a stucco bas-relief from the side of a doorway, representing
a standing human figure in a very damaged
state. A peculiar stucco ornament sketched by Castañeda
is probably from the same room, and is perhaps
identical with what Waldeck describes as a sanctuary
with two birds perched on an elephant's head,
the latter, however, not appearing in the drawing.<a id="FNanchor_VI-30" href="#Footnote_VI-30" class="fnanchor">[VI-30]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Ornament over a Doorway.</p>
</div>

<p>Within the pyramid itself, and above the surface of
the ground, although frequently spoken of as subterranean,
are found apartments, or galleries, with walls
of stone plastered but without ornament, of the same
form and construction as the corridors above. Such
as have been explored are at the south end of the
pyramid and for the most part without the line of the
Palace walls, with lateral galleries, however, extending
under the corridors and affording communication
with the upper apartments by means of stairways.
The arrangement of the galleries and their entrances
is made sufficiently clear by the fine lines at the bottom
of the plan, yet perhaps very little is known of
their original extent. The southernmost gallery receives
a dim light by three holes or windows leading
out to the surface of the pyramid; the other galleries
are dark and damp, with water running over their
pavements in the rainy season. The walls are much
fallen and the galleries blocked up at several points.
At the south-western corner an opening affords a
means of egress near the surface of the ground; but
this, as well as the windows mentioned, may be accidental
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
or of modern origin and have formed no part
of the original plan. These rooms are variously regarded
as sleeping-rooms, dungeons, or sepulchres,
according to the temperament of the observer. Whatever
their use, they contain several of the low tables
mentioned before, one of which is said to have been
richly decorated with sculpture. M. Morelet occupied
one of these lower rooms during his visit, as
being more comfortable than the others, at least in
the dry season. The chief entrance to the vaults
seems to have been from one of the southern rooms
of the building E, at the point <i>r</i>, through an opening
in the floor. A narrow stairway by which the descent
was made, is divided into two flights by a platform
and doorway, surmounting which was the stucco device
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
shown in the cut. Waldeck states that when he
found this decoration it was partially covered with
stalactites formed by trickling water. His explanation,
by which he connects the figures with aboriginal
astronomical signs and the division of time, is
too long and too extremely conjectural to be repeated
here. Stephens noticed this ornament but gives no
drawing of it. It was sketched by Castañeda together
with another somewhat similar one. Dupaix speaks
of two doors in this stairway; Del Rio speaks of several
landings, and says that he brought away a fragment
of one of the ornamented steps. I suspect the
visitors may have confounded this stairway with
another at <i>w</i>, concerning which nothing is particularly
said. Somewhere in connection with these stairways
Dupaix found a tablet of hieroglyphics which he
brought away with him, and concerning which he
states the remarkable fact that on the reverse side of
the tablet, built into the wall, were the same characters
painted that were sculptured on the face. Openings
through the pavement were found at several points,
as in the court 1, and the building C, which led to
no regular galleries, but to simple and small excavations
in the earth, very likely the work of some early
explorer or searcher for hidden treasure.<a id="FNanchor_VI-31" href="#Footnote_VI-31" class="fnanchor">[VI-31]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE PALACE RESTORED.</p>

<p>Having now given all the information in my possession
respecting the Palace, I present in the accompanying
cut a restoration of the structure made by a
German artist, but which I have taken the liberty to
change in several respects. The reader will notice
a few points in which the cut does not exactly agree
with my description; such as the curved surface of
the roofs, the height of the tower and its spire, the
width of the western stairway in court 1, etc., yet it
may be regarded as giving an excellent idea of what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the Palace was in the days when its halls and courts
were thronged with the nobility or priesthood of a
great people. The view is from the north-east on the
bank of the stream, and besides the palace includes
the edifice No. 2 of the general plan.<a id="FNanchor_VI-32" href="#Footnote_VI-32" class="fnanchor">[VI-32]</a></p>

<p>The structure No. 2 shown in the last cut stands a
short distance south-west from the Palace, and may
be known as the Temple of the Three Tablets. The
pyramid supporting it, of the same construction as
the former so far as may be judged from outward examination,
is said by Stephens to measure one hundred
and ten feet on the slope, and seems to have had continuous
steps all round its sides, now much displaced
by the forest. The cut on the following page presents
a view of this temple from the north-east as it appeared
at the time of Catherwood's visit, and illustrates
very vividly the manner in which the ruins are
enveloped in a tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>The building, which stands on the summit platform
but does not like the Palace cover its whole surface,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
is seventy-six feet long, twenty-five feet wide,
and about thirty-five feet high. The front, or northern,
elevation is shown in the cuts. Fig. 1 includes
the temple with the supporting pyramid, and fig. 2
presents the building on a larger scale. Each of
the four central piers on this front has its bas-relief
in stucco, while the two lateral piers have each
ninety-six small squares of hieroglyphics, also in
stucco. The bas-reliefs represent single human figures,
standing, and each bearing in its arms an infant,
or in one instance some unknown object. They are
all very much mutilated, and although drawings have
been published, I do not think it necessary to reproduce
them. The roof is divided into two sections,
sloping at different angles; the lower slope was covered
with painted stucco decorations, and had also five
square solid projections, one over each doorway. The
dividing line between the two slopes marks the height
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
of the apartments in the interior, the upper portion
being solid masonry. Along the ridge of the roof
was a line of pillars, of stone and mortar, eighteen
inches high and twelve inches apart, probably square,
although nothing is said of their shape, and surmounted
by a layer of projecting flat stones. Similar constructions
may possibly have existed originally on some of
the Palace roofs, since they would naturally be among
the first to fall. Waldeck's plate represents a small
platform in front of the doorways, ascended by four
lateral stairways. Respecting the two square projections
below the piers at the side of the central
doorway there is no information except their representation
by Catherwood in the cut, fig. 2.</p>

</div>

<p>The arrangement of the interior is shown in the
accompanying ground plan. The central wall is four
or five feet thick, and is pierced by three doorways,
which afford access to three apartments in the rear.
The front corridor has a small window at each end;
Stephens speaks of two slight openings about three
inches wide in each of the lateral apartments of the
rear; and the plan indicates two similar openings in
the central room, although he speaks of them as dark
and gloomy. Castañeda's drawing shows only one
window at the end; it also represents the building as
having a roof like the Palace, and as standing on a
natural rocky hill in which some steps are cut, no
bas-reliefs or other decorations appearing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
front. The interior walls are perfectly plain, and it
is not even definitely stated that they are plastered.
In the walls, however, at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, of the ground
plan, are fixed stone tablets one foot thick, each composed
of several blocks, neatly joined and covered
with sculptured hieroglyphics. Those in the central
wall, at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, measure eight by thirteen feet, and
contain each two hundred and forty squares of hieroglyphics
in a very good state of preservation, while
the one hundred and forty squares of the tablet in
the rear apartment, three and a half by four feet, are
much damaged by trickling water. Drawings of the
hieroglyphics have been made by Waldeck and Catherwood
only, although other visitors speak of them.
I do not copy the drawings here, because, in the absence
of any key to their meaning, the specimen
which I shall present from another part of the ruins
is as useful to the reader as the whole would be.
The cut is a longitudinal section of this temple at the
central wall, and shows the position of the tablets.
Waldeck's drawing represents the two lateral doorways
as having flat tops. Brasseur tells us that,
according to the statements of the natives, the tablets
were used originally for educational purposes. M.
Charnay found them still undisturbed in 1859.<a id="FNanchor_VI-33" href="#Footnote_VI-33" class="fnanchor">[VI-33]</a>

<p>Some four hundred yards south of the Palace is a
pyramid, only partly artificial if we may credit Dupaix,
and rising with a steep slope of one hundred
feet from the bank of the stream according to Stephens,
on which is a small building, No. 3 of the
plan, which we may call, with Waldeck, the Temple
of the Beau Relief. This edifice was found by later
visitors in an advanced state of ruin, and Catherwood's
drawings of it are much less satisfactory than
in the case of other Palenque ruins; but both Dupaix
and Waldeck found it in a tolerably good state of
preservation, and were enabled to sketch and describe
its principal features. This temple measured eighteen
by twenty feet, apparently fronting the east, and
is twenty-five feet high. It presents the peculiarity
of an apartment in the pyramid, immediately under
the upper rooms. The cut gives ground plans&mdash;No.
1 of the upper, and No. 2 of the lower rooms. The
stairway which afforded communication between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
two, is also shown. Catherwood's drawing, however,
represents the upper and lower apartments as alike in
everything but height. On the rear, or western, wall,
at <i>a</i>, was the Beau Relief in stucco, which gives a
name to the temple, the finest specimen of stucco
work in America, shown in the accompanying cut.

It was sketched by Castañeda and Waldeck, in whose
drawings some differences of detail appear. At the
time of Stephens' visit only the lower portions remained
for study; yet he pronounced this "superior
in execution to any other stucco relief in Palenque."
At the time of Charnay's visit the last vestige of
this beautiful relic had disappeared. Waldeck speaks
of a tomb found in connection with this pyramid,
which he had no time to explore, having made the
discovery just before leaving the ruins.<a id="FNanchor_VI-34" href="#Footnote_VI-34" class="fnanchor">[VI-34]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TEMPLE OF THE CROSS.</p>

<p>Standing about one hundred and fifty yards a little
south of east from the Palace, and on the opposite
bank of the stream Otolum, is the building No. 4 of
the plan, known as the Temple of the Cross, standing
on a pyramid which measures one hundred and thirty-four
feet on the slope. Mr Stephens locates this temple
several hundred feet further south than I have
placed it on the plan. Charnay describes the pyramid
as partly natural but faced with stone. The
temple is fifty feet long, thirty-one feet wide, and
about forty feet high. The cut shows the front, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
southern elevation. The construction of the lower
portion is precisely like that of the other buildings
which have been described. The two lateral piers
were covered with hieroglyphics, and the central ones
bore human figures, all in stucco. The lower slope of
the roof was also covered with stucco decorations,
among which were fragments of a head and two bodies,
pronounced by Stephens to approach the Greek
models in justness of proportion and symmetry. On
the top, the roof formed a platform thirty-five feet
long and about three feet wide, which supported the
peculiar two-storied structure shown in the preceding
cut, fifteen feet and ten inches high. This is a kind
of frame, or open lattice, of stone blocks covered with
a great variety of stucco ornaments. A layer of projecting
flat stones caps the whole, and from the summit,
one hundred feet perhaps above the ground, a
magnificent view is afforded, which stretches over the
whole forest-covered plain to Laguna de Terminos and
the Mexican gulf. This superstructure, like some
that I have described at Uxmal and elsewhere in Yucatan,
would seem to have been added to the temple
solely to give it a more imposing appearance. It
could hardly have served as an observatory, since
there are no facilities for mounting to the summit.<a id="FNanchor_VI-35" href="#Footnote_VI-35" class="fnanchor">[VI-35]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Ground plan&mdash;Temple of the Cross.</p>
</div>

<p>The interior arrangement is made clear by the adjoined
plan. Within the central apartment of the
rear, or northern, corridor, and directly opposite to the
main doorway is an enclosure measuring seven by
thirteen feet. From its being mentioned as an enclosure
rather than a regular room by Stephens, it would
seem probable that it does not reach the full height
of the chamber, but has a ceiling, or covering, of its
own. At any rate, it receives light only by the doorway.
Besides a heavy cornice round the enclosure,
the doorway was surmounted by massive and graceful
stucco decorations, and at its sides on the exterior
were originally two stone tablets bearing each a human
figure sculptured in low relief, resembling in their
general characteristics the more common stucco designs,
but somewhat more elaborately draped and
decorated. One of them wears a leopard-skin as a
cloak. These tablets were sketched by both Waldeck
and Catherwood in the village of Santo Domingo,
whither they had been carried and set up in a modern
house. Stephens understood them to come from
another of the ruins yet to be mentioned, but the evidence
indicates strongly that he was misinformed.
Both Waldeck and Stephens entered into some negotiations
with a view to remove these tablets; at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
time of the former's visit the condition of obtaining
them was to marry one of the proprietresses; in
Stephens' time a purchase of the house in which they
stood would suffice. Neither removed them.<a id="FNanchor_VI-36" href="#Footnote_VI-36" class="fnanchor">[VI-36]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Tablet of the Cross.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">TABLET OF THE CROSS.</p>

<p>Fixed in the wall at the back of the enclosure, and
covering nearly its whole surface, was the tablet of
the cross, six feet four inches high, ten feet eight
inches wide, and formed of three stones. The central
stone, and part of the western, bear the sculptured
figures shown in the cut. The rest of the western,
and all of the eastern stone, were covered with hieroglyphics.
This cut is a photographic reduction of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Waldeck's drawing, the accuracy of which is proved
by a careful comparison with Charnay's photograph.
The subject doubtless possessed a religious signification,
and the location of the tablet may be considered
a sacred altar, or most holy place, of the ancient
Maya or Tzendal priesthood. Two men, probably
priests, clad in the robes and insignia of their office,
are making an offering to the cross or to a bird
perched on its summit. This tablet has been perhaps
the most fruitful theme for antiquarian speculation
yet discovered in America, but a fictitious importance
has doubtless been attached to it by reason of some
fancied connection between the sculptured cross and
the Christian emblem. All agree respecting the excellence
of the sculpture. Of the two priests, Stephens
says: "They are well drawn, and in symmetry
of proportion are perhaps equal to many that are
carved on the walls of the ruined temples in Egypt.
Their costume is in a style different from any heretofore
given, and the folds would seem to indicate that
they were of a soft and pliable texture like cotton."
Stephens and other writers discover a possible likeness
in the object offered to a new-born child. Of
the hieroglyphics which cover the two lateral stones,
the cut on the opposite page shows, as a specimen,
the upper portion of the western stone, or what may
be considered, perhaps, the beginning of the inscription.
The large initial character, like an aboriginal
capital letter, is a remarkable feature. In Dupaix's
time all parts of the tablet were probably in their
place, and in good condition, but his artist only
sketched, and that somewhat imperfectly, the cross
and human figures, omitting the hieroglyphics.
Waldeck and Stephens found and sketched the central
stone in the forest on the bank of the stream,
to which point it had been removed, according to the
former, with a view to its removal to the United
States, but according to the latter its intended destination
had been the village of Santo Domingo.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Stephens says he found the eastern stone entirely
destroyed, though Charnay speaks of it as still in
place nearly twenty years later; why Waldeck made
no drawing of it does not appear.<a id="FNanchor_VI-37" href="#Footnote_VI-37" class="fnanchor">[VI-37]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE ONLY STATUE AT PALENQUE.</p>

<p>This temple is paved with large flags, through
which is an opening made by Del Rio and noticed
by later visitors. From this place Del Rio took a
variety of articles which will be mentioned hereafter.
On the southern slope of this pyramid Waldeck found
two statues, exactly alike, one of which is represented in
the cut on the opposite page, from Catherwood's drawings
in Stephens' work. They are ten and one half
feet high, of which two and a half feet, not shown in
the cut, formed the tenon by which they were imbedded
in the ground or in a wall. The figure stands on
a hieroglyph which perhaps expresses the name of the
individual or god represented. These statues are remarkable
as being the only ones ever found in connection
with the Palenque ruins; and even these are not
statues proper, sculptured 'in the round,' since the
back is of rough stone and was very likely imbedded
originally in a wall. Waldeck believes they were designed
to support a platform before the central doorway.
One of them was broken in two pieces. After
sketching the best preserved of them, Waldeck turned
them face downward that they might escape the eye
of parties who might have better facilities than he
for removing them; but Catherwood afterwards discovered
and sketched the one which remained entire.
The resemblance of this figure to some Egyptian
statues is remarked by all, though Stephens notes in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
the lower part of the dress "an unfortunate resemblance
to modern pantaloons." The space at the
western base of the pyramid where various undescribed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
ruins are indicated on the plan, is described by Stephens
as a level esplanade one hundred and ten feet
wide and supported by a stone terrace wall which rises
sixty feet on the slope from the bank of the stream.<a id="FNanchor_VI-38" href="#Footnote_VI-38" class="fnanchor">[VI-38]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PECULIAR ROOF STRUCTURES</p>

<p>At the south-western base of the pyramid of the
Cross, and almost in contact with it, rises another of
smaller base, but nearly as high, with a still smaller
companion on the north, respecting which latter no
information is given. These pyramids, Nos. 5 and
6 of the plan, are located by Stephens directly south
from the Temple of the Cross, as indicated by the
dotted lines. The building No. 5, sometimes called,
without any sufficient reason, the Temple of the Sun,
is one of the best preserved and most remarkable for
variety of ornamentation of all the Palenque structures,
but is very similar in most respects to its
neighbor of the cross, having the same stuccoed piers
and roof. Its front elevation is shown in the cut,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
from Catherwood. Waldeck's plate differs chiefly in
representing the stucco ornaments in a more perfect
state; but both are confessedly restorations to a certain
extent. Here again we have stucco reliefs of
human figures on the central, and hieroglyphics of
the same material on the lateral piers. The roof
bears a superstructure similar to that already described,
composed of a frame of hewn stone blocks,
supporting complicated decorations in cement, several
of which are modeled to represent human figures
looking from openings in the lattice-work. The stone
frame-work entirely freed from its ornamentation, is
shown in the cut from Waldeck, which presents both
a front and end view. Brasseur believes that these
roof structures were erected by some people that
succeeded the original builders of the temples. It
will be remembered that in Yucatan similar superimposed
structures were found by Stephens and others,
and are for the most part the only ones on which traces
of stucco work are observable.</p>

<p>The dimensions of this temple are twenty-eight by
thirty-eight feet, and its ground plan, identical with
the exception of an additional doorway with that of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
the Temple of the Cross, is shown in the cut. The
central enclosure in the rear, as is clearly shown by
the plates and description in this case, has a roof of
its own. Its interior dimensions are, nine feet long,
five feet wide, and eight feet high. It has on the exterior
a double cornice and graceful ornaments, now
mostly fallen, over the doorways, while at the sides
stood two sculptured reliefs representing human figures,
which although broken in many fragments, were
sketched by Waldeck. The tablets in the village of
Santo Domingo were understood by Stephens to
have come from this apartment.</p>

<p class="caption">Ground plan&mdash;Temple of the Sun.</p>
</div>

<p>Fixed in the rear wall, occupying its whole extent,
and receiving light only through the doorway, is the
Tablet of the Sun, which measures eight by nine feet
and is made of three slabs of stone. In 1842 it was
still unbroken and in place, and was considered by
Stephens to be the most perfect and interesting monument
in Palenque. As in the Tablet of the Cross
the sides are covered with squares of hieroglyphics;
and in the central portion is an object to which two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
priests are in the act of making human offerings.
This central object is a hideous face, or mask, with
protruding tongue, standing on a kind of altar which
is supported on the backs of two crouching human
figures. Two other stooping men support the priests,
who stand on their backs. The name Tablet of the
Sun comes from the face with protruding tongue,
which was sometimes regarded by the Aztecs as a
symbol of the sun;&mdash;a very far-fetched derivation for
the name.<a id="FNanchor_VI-39" href="#Footnote_VI-39" class="fnanchor">[VI-39]</a></p>

<p>The stream on whose banks the ruins stand flows
for a short distance through an artificial covered stone
channel, or aqueduct, about six feet wide, and ten feet
high, covered like all the corridors by an arch of overlapping
blocks. It extends fifty-seven feet from north
to south, and one hundred and sixty feet further south-eastward
toward the Temple of the Cross, where the
fallen roof blocks up the passage and renders further
exploration impracticable. Such is the information
obtained from the works of Waldeck and Stephens.
The position of this structure is indicated on the plan
by the dotted lines numbered 7, although Stephens
locates it considerably further north. There is great
confusion in the accounts of this so-called aqueduct.
Bernasconi included in his report a description and
drawing of a vault seven feet wide, twelve feet high,
and two hundred and twenty-seven feet long, extending
in a curved line from the Palace to the stream.
Del Rio speaks of a "subterranean stone aqueduct of
great solidity and durability, which passes under the
largest building." Dupaix states that a rapid stream,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
a few paces&mdash;Kingsborough's edition has it over a
league&mdash;west of the ruins, runs through a subterranean
aqueduct five and one half feet wide, eleven feet
high, and one hundred and sixty-seven feet long, built
of stone blocks without mortar. The drawings of
this structure, however, in Dupaix and Kingsborough's
works do not bear the slightest resemblance to
each other, one picturing it as a bridge, and the other
as a corridor, or possibly aqueduct, built above the
surface of the ground. Galindo tells us that a stream
rises two hundred paces east of the Palace and is covered
for one hundred paces by a gallery, with traces
of buildings, probably baths, extending fifty paces
further. Waldeck describes the mouth of a subterranean
passage as concealed by a small cataract in the
stream. There seems to be little reason to doubt that
all these conflicting accounts refer to the same structure.
Charnay tells us that the conduit is two mètres
high and wide, and that it is covered with
immense stones.<a id="FNanchor_VI-40" href="#Footnote_VI-40" class="fnanchor">[VI-40]</a></p>

<p>Not far from the Temple of the Sun a small building
eight feet square was found by Waldeck lifted
bodily from the ground by the branches of a large
tree.<a id="FNanchor_VI-41" href="#Footnote_VI-41" class="fnanchor">[VI-41]</a> On an eminence north of the Palace, at 9 of
the plan, are the foundations of several buildings,&mdash;eleven
in number, according to Dupaix, in whose time
some of the arches were still standing. They extend
in a line from east to west, and all front the south.<a id="FNanchor_VI-42" href="#Footnote_VI-42" class="fnanchor">[VI-42]</a>
On the summit of a high steep hill, or mountain, the
slope of which begins immediately to the east of the
Temple of the Cross, are the foundation stones of a
building twenty-one feet square, at 8 of the plan. So
thick is the forest that from this point none of the
ruins below are visible, although the site of the village
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
of Santo Domingo may be seen by climbing a
lofty tree.<a id="FNanchor_VI-43" href="#Footnote_VI-43" class="fnanchor">[VI-43]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Conduit of a Bridge near Palenque.</p>
</div>

<p>Two bridges are indefinitely located in the vicinity
of Palenque. One of them, said by Dupaix to be
north of the Palace, is fifty-six feet long, forty-two
feet wide, and eleven feet high, built of large hewn
blocks without mortar. The conduit is nine feet
wide, having a flat top constructed with a layer of
wide blocks, and convex sides, as illustrated in the
cut. The second bridge was found on the Tulija
River some leagues west of the ruins, and only extends,
according to Galindo, partly across the river,
which is now about five hundred paces wide at that
point.<a id="FNanchor_VI-44" href="#Footnote_VI-44" class="fnanchor">[VI-44]</a> The Abbé Brasseur, during his visit to the
ruins in 1871, claims to have discovered an additional
temple, that of the Mystic Tree, containing hieroglyphic
tablets.<a id="FNanchor_VI-45" href="#Footnote_VI-45" class="fnanchor">[VI-45]</a> Three thousand five hundred paces
southward from the last house of Santo Domingo, on
a stream supposed to be a branch of the Usumacinta,
Waldeck found two pyramids. They are described
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
as having been at the time in a perfect state of preservation,
square at the base, pointed at the top, and
thirty-one feet high, their sides forming equilateral
triangles. Pyramids of this type rarely, if ever,
occur in America, and it is unfortunate that the existence
of these monuments is not confirmed by other
explorers, since without such confirmation it must be
considered very doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_VI-46" href="#Footnote_VI-46" class="fnanchor">[VI-46]</a> Seven leagues north from
the ruins, Galindo found a circular cistern twenty
feet in diameter, two feet high on the outside, and
eight feet on the inside, occupied at the time of his
visit by alligators.<a id="FNanchor_VI-47" href="#Footnote_VI-47" class="fnanchor">[VI-47]</a> According to Ordoñez, one of
Del Rio's companions discovered on the Rio Catasahà,

structure, which contained large quantities of valuable
woods, stored as if for export.<a id="FNanchor_VI-48" href="#Footnote_VI-48" class="fnanchor">[VI-48]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS RELICS.</p>

<p>A few miscellaneous relics, found by visitors at different
points in connection with the ruins of Palenque,
and more or less fully described, remain to be
noticed. Del Rio made an excavation under the
pavement of the central chamber in the Temple of the
Cross, and says: "at about half a yard deep, I found
a small round earthen vessel, about one foot in diameter,
fitted horizontally with a mixture of lime to
another of the same quality and dimensions; these
were removed, and the digging being continued, a
quarter of a yard beneath, we discovered a circular
stone, of rather larger diameter than the first articles,
and on removing this from its position, a cylindrical
cavity presented itself, about a foot wide and the third
of a foot deep, containing a flint lance, two small conical
pyramids with the figure of a heart in dark crystallized
stone; ... there were also two small earthen
jars or ewers with covers containing small stones and a
ball of vermilion.... The situation of the subterranean
depository coincides with the centre of the oratory,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
and in each of the inner angles, near the entrance, is
a cavity like the one before described," containing two
little jars. The same author also speaks of burnt
bricks which seem to have been used sparingly.<a id="FNanchor_VI-49" href="#Footnote_VI-49" class="fnanchor">[VI-49]</a>
Waldeck, having made a similar excavation in what
he calls the temple of the Palace, perhaps the building
C, found a gallery containing hewn blocks of stone,
and earthen cups and vases with many little earthen
balls of different colors. He also speaks of a fine
fragment of terra cotta which he found in the court 1
where he also discovered just before leaving Palenque
the entrance to other galleries of the pyramid. Waldeck
also gives drawings of two images of human form
in terra cotta, from Dr Corroy's collection; also a face,
or mask, in stucco from the cornice of the Temple of
Death, whatever that building may have been.<a id="FNanchor_VI-50" href="#Footnote_VI-50" class="fnanchor">[VI-50]</a> Galindo
found stones apparently for grinding maize, similar
to the Mexican <i>metate</i>; also artificially shaped
pebbles, similar, as he says, to those used by the modern
Lacandones but smaller. Both Galindo and Dupaix
speak of a circular granite stone, like a mill-stone,
six feet in diameter and one foot thick, found
on the side or at the foot of the Palace pyramid.
Dupaix found at a distance of a league westward
from the ruins, a square pillar fourteen feet in circumference,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
and about the same in height, with two short
round pillars standing at its eastern foot. He also
speaks of finding many small altars probably used originally
for burning copal. One of them, four feet in
circumference and sixteen inches high, is represented
in the preceding cut.<a id="FNanchor_VI-51" href="#Footnote_VI-51" class="fnanchor">[VI-51]</a> At the sale of a collection of
antiquities in London, 1859, two of the objects sold
are, erroneously in all probability, mentioned as relics
from Palenque; one was "a mask, with open mouth,
in hard red stone, the concave surface sculptured with
a sitting figure of a Mexican chief, surrounded by
various emblems," price thirteen pounds; the other, "a
Mexican deity, with grotesque human face sculptured
out of a very large and massive piece of greenstone,"
price twenty-five pounds. Mr Davis talks about "an
idol of pure gold about six inches long."<a id="FNanchor_VI-52" href="#Footnote_VI-52" class="fnanchor">[VI-52]</a> The two
copper or bronze medals which I have already noticed
as probably not authentic relics in my account of Guatemalan
antiquities, have been considered by various
writers, following Ordoñez without any apparent reason,
as belonging to Palenque. The speculations to
which they have given rise, and their attempted interpretations
are splendid specimens of the trash, pure
and simple, which has been written in unlimited quantities
about primitive America.<a id="FNanchor_VI-53" href="#Footnote_VI-53" class="fnanchor">[VI-53]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF OCOCINGO.</p>

<p>Some thirty-five or forty miles southward from
Palenque, on another of the parallel streams which
unite to form a branch of the Usumacinta, is another
important group of ruins, which may be called Ococingo,
from the name of a modern village, five or six
miles distant toward the west. The same traditions
that tell us of Votan's great Maya empire, and of
Xibalba, allude also somewhat vaguely to another
great capital called Tulhá. Juarros, perhaps following
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Ordoñez, applied this name to the ruins of Ococingo,
and most authors have followed him in this
respect. I need not say, however, that the only
authority for this use of the name is the traditional
existence in the shadowy past, of a Tulhá in this
region. The natives call the ruins Tonila, which in
the Tzendal tongue signifies 'stone houses.' Notwithstanding
the importance of the ruins, very little
is known of them. Stephens and Catherwood spent
about half a day here just before their visit to Palenque;
and Dupaix and Castañeda also visited this
point. The accounts by these explorers are about all
there is extant on the subject, but they are necessarily
brief, and unfortunately neither in text nor drawings
do they agree at all with each other. Both
Waldeck and Brasseur visited Ococingo, but neither
gives any description of the monuments.<a id="FNanchor_VI-54" href="#Footnote_VI-54" class="fnanchor">[VI-54]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF OCOCINGO.</p>

<p>At the village of Ococingo Stephens noticed two
sculptured figures brought from the ruins, which he
pronounced "somewhat in the same style as those at
Copan." Castañeda also saw and sketched here two
tablets, which may be the same. One of them measured
forty-five by thirty-six by four inches, was of a
grayish stone, and contained a single human figure,
whose arms were bound behind the back with
what resembles a modern rope. The other measuring
thirty-six by twenty-seven inches, was of a
yellow stone, and contained a standing and a squatting
figure, surrounded by a border in which hieroglyphics
appear. On the way from the village,
Stephens noticed two well-carved figures lying on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
ground; while Dupaix found several of them thrown
down and broken, two of which were sketched. One
of them represents a human bust with arms crossed
on the breast, the lower portion of which seems to be a
kind of tenon originally fixed in the ground; the other
bears a slight resemblance to the only statue found
at Palenque. This statue must have been removed
by Dupaix, since it was afterwards seen by Waldeck
in Vera Cruz. Both statues had lost their heads.<a id="FNanchor_VI-55" href="#Footnote_VI-55" class="fnanchor">[VI-55]</a></p>

<p>In the possession of some French citizens of Vera
Cruz, Waldeck found a collection of seven or eight
terra-cottas of very fine workmanship and very curious
form, which had been brought from Ococingo.
Two of them are shown in the accompanying cuts.<a id="FNanchor_VI-56" href="#Footnote_VI-56" class="fnanchor">[VI-56]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
The figure shown in the cut was carved in bas-relief
on a hard and polished chalchiuite which was found
in this vicinity. The design is represented full-sized,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
and its resemblance to one of the figures on the stone
tablet in the Palace at Palenque will be apparent to
the reader. Another similar stone bore the hieroglyphics
shown in the preceding cut, which was also
given in the second volume of this work as an illustration
of the Maya system of writing. M. Warden
speaks indefinitely of ancient monuments in this
vicinity, in connection with which were stone figures
representing warriors of great size.<a id="FNanchor_VI-57" href="#Footnote_VI-57" class="fnanchor">[VI-57]</a></p>

<p>This brings us to the ruins proper. They are situated
a little north of east from the village, at a distance
of five or six miles. Dupaix describes them as
located on the slope of a hill, on the sides of which
are some stone steps, and as consisting of five structures.
The central building is nearly square, built of
hewn stone, and covered with plaster, without exterior
decorations. The drawing represents a double
cornice, and a sloping roof, very similar to those of
the interior Palace buildings at Palenque. There is
only one door, on the west, and two square windows
appear on each side. A few rods in front of this
building, at the sides of the broad stairway leading
up to it, and facing each other, are two other buildings
of similar construction, but so small that the roof
is pointed, its slopes forming four triangular surfaces.
In the rear of the central structure, in positions corresponding
to those of the buildings in front but at a
greater distance, are two conical mounds of masonry
covered with cement. Each is sixty feet high and
two hundred feet in diameter, being pointed at the
top; indeed, the only specimen of pointed stone pyramids
seen by Dupaix in his explorations.<a id="FNanchor_VI-58" href="#Footnote_VI-58" class="fnanchor">[VI-58]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Winged Globe from Ococingo.</p>
</div>

<p>Stephens also describes the ruins, or the principal
ones at least, as located "on a high elevation," but
the elevation is an immense artificial pyramidal structure,
built in five terraces. The surface was originally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
faced with stone and plastered, but was so broken
up in places that Stephens was able to ascend to the
third terrace on horseback. On the summit of this
terraced hill is a pyramid, high and steep, which
supports a stone building measuring thirty-five by
fifty feet on the ground, built of hewn stone, and
covered with stucco. This is perhaps identical with
the central building sketched by Dupaix. The only
exterior doorway is in the centre of the front, and is
ten feet wide. The ground plan is very similar to
those of the temples of the Cross and Sun at Palenque,
except that the front corridor is divided by
partition walls, while the rear corridor is uninterrupted
except by an oblong enclosure, which, as at
Palenque, seems to have been a kind of sanctuary.
The dimensions of this enclosure are eleven by eighteen
feet, and over the doorway on the outside is a
stucco ornament which arrested Mr Stephens' attention
from its resemblance to the 'winged globe' of
the Egyptian temples. A portion which was yet in
place was sketched by Catherwood; the rest, which
had fallen face downward, was too heavy for four
men and a boy to overturn. Waldeck, however,
either succeeded in raising the fragments, or, what is
more likely, copied the standing part and restored
the rest from his imagination, producing the drawing,
a part of which is copied in the cut. The lintel of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
this inner doorway is of zapote-wood, and in perfect
preservation. The entrance to this sanctuary was
much obstructed by fallen fragments, and the natives,
who had never dared to penetrate the mysterious
recess, believed the passage to lead by a subterranean
course to Palenque. Stephens succeeded in entering
the room, and found its walls covered with stucco
decorations, including two life-sized human figures
and a monkey.</p>

<p>From the top of the first building was seen another
of similar plan and construction, but in a more damaged
condition. It probably stands on the same
terraced foundation, although no definite information
is given on this point. Two other buildings supported
by pyramids were seen. Stephens also speaks
of an open table, probably the former site of the city,
protected on all sides by the terraced structures
which overlook the country far around. There is
also a high narrow causeway, partially artificial, extending
from the ruins to a mountain range, and
bearing on its summit a mound and the foundations
of a building, or tower. Of these ruins Mr Stephens
says "there was no place we had seen which gave us
such an idea of the vastness of the works erected by
the aboriginal inhabitants."<a id="FNanchor_VI-59" href="#Footnote_VI-59" class="fnanchor">[VI-59]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MISCELLANEOUS RUINS.</p>

<p class="p2">I have found no very definite information about the
antiquities of Chiapas, except the ruins of Palenque
and Ococingo. In a statistical work on Chiapas and
Soconusco by Emilio Pineda there are the following
brief mentions of scattered monuments: In one of the
hills near Comitan is a stone table; and a sun, sculptured
in stone, serves as a boundary mark on the frontier.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Remains are still visible of the cities which formerly
stood in the valleys of Custepeques and Xiquipilas,
including remains of giants; also of those at Laguna
Mora, five leagues from the left bank of the river
Chiapas, between the pueblo of Acalá, and the valley
of Custepeques, believed to have been the towns of
Tizapetlan and Teotilac, where Cortés hung the Aztec
king Guatimozin and others; also those of Copanabastla,
where columns are mentioned. There are,
besides, some sepulchres of the Tzendal nobles, two
of which are especially worthy of note. The first is
between the pueblo of Zitalá and the hacienda of
Boxtic, twenty-two leagues north-west of San Cristóval.
"Its base is a parallelogram formed from a hill
cut down on three sides, so that at the entrance one
seems to be ascending an inclined plain; but further
along is seen an elevation with grades, or terraces,
chiefly on the sides which are cut away. On the summit
plane is found an enormous cone, built of hewn
blocks of slate, whose base is about two hundred
varas in circumference. In the centre are the sepulchres,
and in some of them human bones. The ascent
to them is by steps, and the whole seems like a vast
winding stairway, for which reason it is called Bololchun,
meaning in the Tzendal tongue a 'coiled snake.'
Similar to this, is another at the hacienda of San
Gregorio, near the pueblo of Huistan, eight leagues
east of the city of San Cristóval; but the latter has
no supporting mound, but stands on the level of the
ground. Here are two Egyptian pyramids, considering
their form and purpose." Walls of masonry are mentioned
on the hill of Colmena, four leagues from Ocosucoautla;
being nine feet thick, seven feet high, and
enclosing a circular space forty-five feet in diameter.
There is also a wall on the hill of Petapa, south of
Ocosucoautla; but the most notable is that of Santoton,
near Teopisca, seven leagues south-west of San
Cristóval. Two parallel walls extend a long distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
having at one end a ditch, and at the other a high
steep mound; within the walls was a town.<a id="FNanchor_VI-60" href="#Footnote_VI-60" class="fnanchor">[VI-60]</a></p>

<p>Among the relics found at Huehuetan in Soconusco
at the end of the seventeenth century, and
publicly destroyed, are said to have been some sculptured
stones; and we have a statement that the
shapeless ruins of the city itself are still visible on a
hill near the Pacific, at the modern town of Tlazoaloyan.<a id="FNanchor_VI-61" href="#Footnote_VI-61" class="fnanchor">[VI-61]</a>
The ruins of the aboriginal Tonalá, a town
captured by Pedro de Alvarado, are said to be still
seen on the banks of a laguna communicating with
the sea, near the Tehuantepec frontier. The ancient
Ghowel, or Huey Zacatlan, is supposed to have stood
on the present site of San Cristóval, where some
traces are reported. Dupaix mentions a human head,
wearing a kind of helmet, cut from green porphyry.
This relic was in the possession of Sr Ordoñez.<a id="FNanchor_VI-62" href="#Footnote_VI-62" class="fnanchor">[VI-62]</a></p>

<p>Brasseur states that the town of Chiapa de Indios,
twelve leagues from San Cristóval, is "full of
ruins;" and he thinks that obelisks, on one of which
there is a tradition of an old king having inscribed
his name, and other ruins like those at Copan and
Quirigua will some time be brought to light in the
forests about Comitan. Hermosa mentions two stones
cut in the form of tongues, nine feet long and two
feet wide, at Quixté, the location of which I am unable
to find. Galindo speaks of some extraordinary
and magnificent ruins in a cave somewhere on the
left bank of the Usumacinta near the falls; and
somewhat lower down, about three miles from Tenosique,
a remarkable monumental stone, with inscribed
characters. And finally, among the wonderful pretended
discoveries of Leon de Pontelli, were the
ruined cities of Ostuta and Copanahuaxtla, southward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
of Palenque, and in the vicinity of San Bartolomé.<a id="FNanchor_VI-63" href="#Footnote_VI-63" class="fnanchor">[VI-63]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">COMPARISONS.</p>

<p class="p2">I have now presented to the reader all that is
known of Palenque, and the few other relics of antiquity
that have been found in Chiapas. Since the
monuments described are nearly all found in one locality,
a general résumé seems less necessary than in
the chapter on Yucatan antiquities, where the remains
of many cities, with numerous variations in
detail, were described. Yet a brief consideration of
the leading points of resemblance and contrast between
the two groups is important. In Palenque, as
in Yucatan, we have low, narrow buildings of stone
and mortar, standing on the summit platforms of
artificial pyramidal elevations faced with masonry.
There are no traces of city walls or other fortifications.
Galleries are found within the Palace pyramid, and
that of the Beau Relief; they were also found in
Yucatan at Maxcanú, reported at Izamal, and may
very likely exist in other pyramids. The building-material,
stone, mortar, and wood, were apparently
the same in both groups of ruins, although at Palenque
the wood has disappeared. Respecting the form and
dimensions of the hewn blocks, our information is
less complete than is desirable, especially in the case
of Palenque. I believe, however, that no importance
can be attached to Galindo's remark that the blocks
at Palenque are only two inches thick, and it is probable
that the blocks used in both groups are of varying
forms and dimensions, as indeed I am informed
by a gentleman residing in San Francisco, who visited
the ruins in 1860. Mortar, plaster, or stucco
was used in greater profusion at Palenque, but there
is no reason to suppose that it differed in composition
or excellence; the bright-colored paints also, although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
better preserved in Yucatan, were, so far as can be
known, everywhere the same in the Maya ruins.<a id="FNanchor_VI-64" href="#Footnote_VI-64" class="fnanchor">[VI-64]</a></p>

<p>Interiors here as before consist for the most part of
two narrow parallel corridors, with perpendicular
walls for half their height, and covered by triangular
arches of overlapping blocks of stone. Both walls
and ceilings are covered with plaster, and both painted
and stucco decorations occur on their surface. Poles
originally stretched across from ceiling to ceiling, the
poles themselves remaining in Yucatan, and the holes
in which they were placed at Palenque. At the sides
of many doorways on the interior are simple contrivances
for supporting doors or curtains.<a id="FNanchor_VI-65" href="#Footnote_VI-65" class="fnanchor">[VI-65]</a> The Palace,
like those of the Yucatan structures which seem
to have been intended partially for the residence of
priests or lords, is built about an enclosed courtyard,
but at Palenque the building is continuous instead of
being composed of four separate structures as at Uxmal;
and the court, unlike those in Yucatan, contains
other structures. The strongest bond connecting Palenque
to Uxmal, Kabah, and their sister cities,
together with Copan, is the evident identity of the
hieroglyphic characters inscribed on their tablets.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Respecting this identity all writers are agreed, but
the reader, with the specimens given in the preceding
pages, will require no other authority on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_VI-66" href="#Footnote_VI-66" class="fnanchor">[VI-66]</a>
Both Palenque and Yucatan are also alike remarkable
for the comparative absence of idols, statues, implements,
and pottery; and, except in the matter of
statues, Copan may be classed with them. The human
faces sculptured or molded in profile in Yucatan and
Chiapas exhibit the same flattened forehead, although
the type is much more strongly marked at Palenque.
The absence of all warlike subjects is remarkable in
the stucco and sculptured figures at Palenque as in
all the more ancient remains of Central America.</p>

<p>Together with the resemblances pointed out and
others that will occur to the student of this and the
preceding chapters, there are also strongly marked
contrasts to be noted. In nearly every city of Yucatan
there are one or more pyramids on the summits
of which no traces of buildings appear, apparently
designed for the performance of religious rites in sight
of the assembled people, but possibly having served
originally to support wooden structures; while at Palenque
each pyramid seems to have borne its edifice
of stone. The number of buildings apparently intended
as temples, in comparison with those which
may have served also as residences for priests or rulers,
seems much greater at Palenque. Many of the pyramids
in Yucatan had broad terraces on their sides; at
Palenque none appear, although a terraced elevation
has been noticed at Ococingo. Some of the Yucatan
pyramids are built of a concrete of rough stones and
mortar; some of those at Palenque are chiefly composed
of earth, but our information is not sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
full on this point to warrant the conclusion that there
is any uniform difference in the structure of the pyramids.
The sides of the pyramids have in Chiapas no
decorations either in stone or stucco, but such decorations
in stucco may have existed and have left no trace.
Coming now to the superimposed edifices we note that
none are found of more than one story at Palenque,
while in Yucatan two or three stories are of common
occurrence. The walls at Palenque are much thinner,
are built entirely of hewn stone, and lack, so far as the
authorities go, the filling of rubble found in Yucatan.
While the arch of overlapping stones is constructed
in precisely the same manner, yet, as I have said, the
projecting corners are beveled in Yucatan, while at
Palenque a plain surface is produced by the aid of
mortar. Doorways in the ruins of Yucatan have for
the most part, except at Uxmal, stone lintels; in
those of Palenque there is no very positive evidence
of their use. In the former the principal exterior entrances
have arched tops; in the latter no such structure
appears. In the former the roof seems to have
been flat, cemented, and plain; in the latter they were
sloping, and decorated with stucco. In Yucatan columns
occur occasionally both in doorways and elsewhere,
but there are no windows; while in Chiapas
small windows appear in most buildings, but no columns.
Traces of a phallic worship are apparent in
the Yucatan sculptured figures; at Palenque no such
traces have been pointed out, and there is not among
the many tablets or decorations in stucco, a single figure
which would be offensive to the most prudish
modesty. It is not necessary to speak of the exterior
stairways, the isolated arch, the round buildings, the
flat wooden roof, and other peculiar edifices which
were found in Yucatan and have no counterpart at
Palenque. The most marked contrast is in the use of
stone and stucco for exterior ornamentation. No stone
sculpture is seen on the outer walls of any Palenque
building; while in Yucatan, except in superimposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
ornamental roof-structures, stucco very rarely appears.<a id="FNanchor_VI-67" href="#Footnote_VI-67" class="fnanchor">[VI-67]</a></p>

<p>The resemblances in the different groups of ruins
in Chiapas, Yucatan, and Honduras, are more than
sufficient to prove intimate connection between the
builders and artists. The differences pointed out
prove just as conclusively that the edifices were not
all erected and decorated by the same people, under
the same laws and religious control, at the same
epoch.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ANTIQUITY OF PALENQUE.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the question of the age of
Palenque, the date of its foundation and abandonment.
It has already been shown that the Yucatan
structures were built by the direct ancestors of the
Mayas who occupied the peninsula at the time of
the conquest; that they were not abandoned wholly
until the coming of the Spaniards, although partially
so during the two centuries preceding that event;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
that the reasons adduced for and against the great
antiquity of the ruins by different authors, bear almost
exclusively on the date of their abandonment
rather than that of their erection; and that the latter
date, so far as anything can be known of it, depends
chiefly on traditional history, which indicates that
the cities were built at different dates from the third
to the tenth century. It is chiefly by comparison
with the ruined cities of Yucatan that the age of
Palenque must be determined, since there is no traditional
history that relates definitely to this city,
and it was doubtless abandoned before the Spaniards
came; for it is hardly possible that a great inhabited
city could have remained utterly unknown during the
conquest of this part of the country, especially as
Cortés is known to have passed within thirty miles of
its site. In favor of great antiquity for Palenque,
the growth of large trees on the ruins, the accumulation
of vegetable mold in the courtyards, and the
disappearance of all traces of wood, have been considered
strong arguments; but they all bear on the
date of abandonment rather than of building, as do
the rapid crumbling of the ruins since their discovery,
the remains of bright-colored paint, the destructiveness
of tropical climate and vegetation, and the comparison
with some European ruins of known age.
The size of trees and accumulation of earth are
known to be very uncertain tests of age in this
region; indeed the clearings and excavations of the
earlier explorers seem to have left few signs visible to
those who came a few years later. The utter disappearance
of wooden lintels is, however, a very strong
argument that Palenque was abandoned some centuries
earlier than the cities of the peninsula, where
the lintels were found often in perfect preservation,
although it cannot be conclusively shown that the
same kind of wood was employed. When we add to
this the more advanced state of ruin of the Palenque
structures, and the utter silence of all later traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
respecting any great city or religious centre in this
region, it seems safe to conclude that Palenque was
abandoned, or left without repairs, as early as the
twelfth or thirteenth century, and possibly earlier.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FOUNDATION OF PALENQUE.</p>

<p>Respecting the date when the city was built, we
have the resemblances to Yucatan ruins already noticed,
which show beyond doubt that it was built&mdash;under
different conditions, such as religion and government
possibly&mdash;by a people of the same race and language,
and not by an extinct race as has been
sometimes imagined. The present deteriorated condition
of the natives, and the flattened foreheads of the
sculptured figures have been the strongest reasons for
believing in an extinct race; but the former has been
shown, I believe, in the three preceding volumes of
this work to have no weight, and the peculiar cranial
conformation may be much more simply and as satisfactorily
explained by supposing that in ancient as in
modern times the forehead was artificially flattened.
Then we have the strong differences noticeable between
Uxmal and Palenque, which lead us to conclude
that these cities must have been built either at
widely different epochs, or by branches of the Maya
race which had long been separated, or by branches,
which through the influence of foreign tribes lived
under greatly modified institutions. It cannot be accurately
determined to what extent the last two conditions
prevailed, but from what is known of Maya
history, and the uniformity of Maya institutions, I
am inclined to attribute most of the architectural and
sculptural differences noted to the lapse of time, and
to allow a difference of a few centuries between the
dates of building. I must confess my inability to
judge from the degree of art displayed respectively in
the peninsular ruins and those of Palenque, which are
the older; I will go further, and while in a confessional
mood, confess to a shade of skepticism respecting the
ability of other writers to form a well-founded judgment
in the matter. Authors are, however, unanimous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
in the opinion that Palenque was founded before
any of the cities of Yucatan, an opinion which is
supported to a certain extent by traditional history,
which represents Votan's empire in Chiapas and Tabasco
as preceding chronologically the allied Maya
empire in the peninsula. If the Yucatan cities flourished,
as I have conjectured, between the third and
tenth centuries, Palenque may be conjecturally referred
to a period between the first and eighth centuries.
I regard the theory that Palenque was built by
the Toltecs after their expulsion from Anáhuac in the
tenth century as wholly without foundation; and I
believe that it would be equally impossible to prove
or disprove that the Palace was standing at the birth
of Christ. It must be added that Brasseur and some
others regard the stucco decorations and especially the
peculiar roof-structures as the work of a later people
than the original builders, or at least, of a later epoch
and grade of culture.<a id="FNanchor_VI-68" href="#Footnote_VI-68" class="fnanchor">[VI-68]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">OLD WORLD RESEMBLANCES.</p>

<p>Respecting the vague resemblances in the Palenque
monuments to old-world ruins, there is very
little to be said. The earlier observers were not permitted
by their religious faith to doubt that the
builders must be connected with some race of the old
world; they were, however, allowed to use their
judgment to a certain extent in determining which
should have the credit, and most of them discovered
the strongest similarities to Egyptian antiquities,
although Dupaix could find no likeness in the hieroglyphics.
Later authorities are not disposed to admit
a marked likeness to the monuments of any
particular nation of Europe, Asia, or Africa, although
finding vague and perhaps accidental similarities to
those of many of the older nations. My acquaintance
with old-world antiquities is not sufficiently
thorough to give any weight to my individual opinion
in the matter, and I have no space for the introduction
of descriptive text and illustrative plates. I give
in a note the opinions of some writers on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_VI-69" href="#Footnote_VI-69" class="fnanchor">[VI-69]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ART DISPLAYED AT PALENQUE.</p>

<p>I close my account of Maya antiquities with the
following brief quotations respecting Palenque, and
the degree of art exhibited in her ruined monuments.
"These sculptured figures are not caricatures, but display
an ability on the part of the artists to represent
the human form in every posture, and with anatomical
fidelity. Nor are the people in humble life here
delineated. The figures are royal or priestly; some
are engaged in offering up sacrifices, or are in an attitude
of devotion; many hold a scepter, or other baton
of authority; their apparel is gorgeous; their head-dresses
are elaborately arrayed, and decorated with
long feathers."<a id="FNanchor_VI-70" href="#Footnote_VI-70" class="fnanchor">[VI-70]</a> "Many of the reliefs exhibit the
finest and most beautiful outlines, and the neatest
combinations, which remind one of the best Indian
works of art."<a id="FNanchor_VI-71" href="#Footnote_VI-71" class="fnanchor">[VI-71]</a> "The ruins of Palenque have been
perhaps overrated; these remains are fine, doubtless,
in their antique rudeness; they breathe out in the
midst of their solitude a certain imposing grandeur;
but it must be affirmed, without disputing their architectural
importance, that they do not justify in their
details the enthusiasm of archæologists. The lines
which make up the ornamentation are faulty in rectitude;
the designs in symmetry; the sculpture in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
finish; I except, however, the symbolic tablets, the
sculpture of which seemed to me very correct." "I
admire the bas-reliefs of Palenque on the façades of
her old palaces; they interest me, move me, and fill
my imagination; but let them be taken to the Louvre,
and I see nothing but rude sketches which leave me
cold and indifferent."<a id="FNanchor_VI-72" href="#Footnote_VI-72" class="fnanchor">[VI-72]</a> "The most remarkable remains
of an advanced ancient civilization hitherto
discovered on our continent." "Their general characteristics
are simplicity, gravity, and solidity."<a id="FNanchor_VI-73" href="#Footnote_VI-73" class="fnanchor">[VI-73]</a>
"While superior in the execution of the details, the
Palenque artist was far inferior to the Egyptian in

him."<a id="FNanchor_VI-74" href="#Footnote_VI-74" class="fnanchor">[VI-74]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NAHUA MONUMENTS.</p>

<p>I now enter what has been classified in a preceding
volume of this work as the home of the Nahua nations,&mdash;nations,
most of which were at the time of
the Spanish conquest, and during the preceding century,
subjected to the allied powers of Anáhuac, and
were more or less closely related to the nations of the
central valley, in blood, language, or institutions. It
has been seen, in what has been said on the subject,<a id="FNanchor_VII-1" href="#Footnote_VII-1" class="fnanchor">[VII-1]</a>
that the dividing line between the Nahuas and
Mayas, drawn across the isthmus of Tehuantepec, is
not a very sharply defined one. Many analogies,
linguistic, institutionary, and mythologic, were found
between nations dwelling on different sides of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
line; so in monumental relics, and in traditional
history, we shall find many points of similarity; but
on the whole, the resemblances will be so far outweighed
by the differences, as "to indicate either a
separate culture from the beginning, or what is more
probable, and for us practically the same thing, a
progress in different paths for a long time prior to
the coming of the Europeans," to repeat the words of
a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The relics to be described in the present chapter
are those of the isthmus proper, and of that portion
of the Mexican Republic above the isthmus which
lies in general terms south of the eighteenth parallel
of latitude, including the states of Oajaca and Guerrero,
and stretching on the Pacific from Tonalá to the
mouth of the Rio Zacatula, a distance of between
five and six hundred miles. The province of Tehuantepec,
belonging politically to the state of Oajaca,
includes the central continental mountain chain, with
the plains on the Pacific at its southern base, a region
somewhat less fertile and attractive than those in
which many of the ruins already described are situated.
The two chief mountain ranges of the Mexican
Republic, one skirting the Atlantic, the other
the Pacific shore, draw near each other as the continent
narrows, and meet in Tehuantepec. The southern
portions of these two converging ranges, the
broad mountain-girt valleys in the angle formed by
their junction, and a narrow strip of tierra caliente
on the southern coast, constitute the state of Oajaca,
the home of the Miztecs, Zapotecs, and other tribes
somewhat less civilized, powerful, and celebrated.
The interior valleys are for the most part in the
tierra templada, and include some of the best agricultural
land in the country, with all the larger towns
grouped round the capital as a centre. Guerrero is
made up of the very narrow lowlands of the coast,
the southern mountain range extending through its
whole length from north-west to south-east, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>
valley of the Zacatula further north. It is a region
but little known to travelers, except along the great
national highway, or trail, which leads from Acapulco,
the most important port of the state, to the city of
Mexico.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF GUIENGOLA.</p>

<p>Five or six leagues from the city of Tehuantepec,
the capital of the province of the same name, and in
the south-western corner of the province, have been
found the remains of an aboriginal fortification or fortified
town, which, according to the traditional annals
of the country, was built by the Zapotecs, not very
long before the Conquest, to resist the advance of the
Aztec forces. The principal remains are on a lofty
hill, the cerro of Guiengola, but the fortified territory
is said to extend over an area measuring one and a
half by over four leagues, the outer walls being visible
throughout the entire circumference at every naturally
accessible point. Besides the protecting walls
there are remains of dwellings, all of stone without
mortar, except a cornice on the larger walls. Three
fortresses covered with a coating of hard plaster are
mentioned. Ditches accompany the walls and add to
the strength of the works. From a subterranean
sepulchre were taken about two hundred pieces of
pottery, including vases and imitations of various
animals. The tombs had a coating of compact cement,
and the skeletons found in them were lying face down.
The preceding information I take from a very vague
account written by Sr Arias and published in the
<i>Museo Mexicano</i>. Arias visited the locality in 1833;
he claims to have sent some very interesting relics,
found at Guiengola and other localities in the vicinity
of Tehuantepec, to the museum at Oajaca; but the
man to whom they were entrusted probably disposed
of them in a manner more profitable to himself, if
less advantageous to the museum. Several natural
caves are spoken of by Arias, and one of them, seventy
feet deep, showed traces, according to the German
traveler Müller, of having been formerly inhabited.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
The latter also found vestiges of dwellings
scattered throughout the vicinity, and speaks of a
well-preserved tumulus standing not long before his
visit in a valley close by. It was thirty-three feet
high, with a base of ninety by one hundred and five
feet, and a summit platform sixty by seventy-five feet,
reached by a stairway of twenty-five wide steps. At
the side of this tumulus was a quadrilateral elevation
covering an area of about two acres, and enclosed by
a wall eight feet high and twelve feet thick. Whether
these structures are identical with the 'castles' of
Arias is uncertain. A correspondent of <i>Hutchings'
Magazine</i> in 1858 describes a wall of rough stones
four feet thick and thirty feet high, said to extend
nine miles. This writer speaks also of buildings with
pillars in their centre, and of quarries from which the
stone was originally taken. Some plans accompanied
Arias' report but were not published. Unsatisfactory
as it certainly is, the preceding is all the information
extant respecting these remains,<a id="FNanchor_VII-2" href="#Footnote_VII-2" class="fnanchor">[VII-2]</a> or at least referred
definitely to Guiengola by name; but some remains
were described by Dupaix and sketched by Castañeda,
at a point three leagues west of Tehuantepec, which
undoubtedly belonged to this group, and were probably
the same ruins which the other writers so vaguely
mention. On the top of a high hill, surrounded by
other grand ruins, are two pyramids of hewn stone
and mortar. The first is fifty-five by one hundred
and twenty feet at the base, and thirty by sixty-six
feet at the summit. The main stairway, thirty feet
wide, of forty steps, leads up the centre of the western
slope; there are also narrower stairways on the
north and south. The pyramid is built in four terraces,
the walls of the lower one being perpendicular;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>
and of all the rest sloping. The whole surface was
covered with a brilliant cement of lime, sand, and red
ochre. No remains whatever were found on the summit.
A remarkable feature is noticed on the surface
of the second story, from which project throughout
the whole circumference, except where interrupted by
the stairways, four ranges of flat stones, forming hundreds
of small shelves. The only suggestions made
respecting the possible use to which these shelves
were devoted are that they supported torches or human
skulls.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i370"></a>
<img src="images/i370.jpg" width="550" height="281" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pyramid near Tehuantepec.</p>
</div>

<p>The second pyramid is shown in the accompanying
cut. The dimensions of the base and summit platform
are about the same as those of the former pyramid,
but the height is over fifty feet. The chief stairway,
shown in the cut, is on the east, and narrower
stairways also afford access to the summit on the
north and south. The curved slope of the lower story
constitutes a feature not found in American pyramids
farther south, and rarely if at all in the north. The
upper story has three projections, or cornices, on its
perpendicular sides; and between them is set a row
of blocks, said to be white marble, bearing sculptured
designs in bas-relief. Three of these blocks with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>
their sculptured figures, found by Castañeda at the
foot of the pyramid, are shown in the cut. Of the
building which appears on the summit nothing is
known further than may be gathered from the cut.
The sides of the pyramid were covered with cement,
which was doubtless in a much more dilapidated condition
than is indicated in the drawing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i371"></a>
<img src="images/i371.jpg" width="494" height="136" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Marble Tablets from Tehuantepec.</p>
</div>

<p>Near the pyramids, and perhaps used in connection
with them as an altar, is a structure comprised of
eight circular masses of stone and mortar, like mill-stones
in shape, placed one above another, and diminishing
in size towards the top. The base is ten
feet and a half in diameter, and the summit about
four feet and a half, the height being about twelve
feet. Kingsborough's translation, without any apparent
authority, represents this monument as standing
on a base sixty-six feet long and twelve feet high.</p>

<p>About a hundred paces in front of the second
pyramid, stands a structure precisely similar to the
lower story of that just described, twelve feet in
diameter and three feet high. Both of these altar-like
pyramids were built of regular blocks of stone,
and covered with a hard white plaster. Dupaix suggests
that the latter was a gladiatorial stone, or possibly
intended for theatrical representations.<a id="FNanchor_VII-3" href="#Footnote_VII-3" class="fnanchor">[VII-3]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MONUMENTS OF TEHUANTEPEC.</p>

<p>In the city of Tehuantepec, or in its immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>
vicinity, Dupaix found a flint lance-head of peculiar
shape, having three cutting edges, like a bayonet.
Its dimensions were one and a half by six inches, and
the end was evidently intended to be fixed in a socket
on the shaft. Cuts of four terra-cotta idols, sent to
the Mexican Museum probably by Arias, already
mentioned, are given in a Mexican magazine, and
also in a Spanish edition of Prescott's work. Two of
them wear horrible masks, the main feature of which
is the projection from the mouth of six large tusks,
like those of some fierce animal or monster. The
same Arias speaks of a statue representing a naked
woman, but broken in pieces; also a stone tablet covered
with hieroglyphics. A small earthen bowl or
censer, with a long handle, was presented to the
American Ethnological Society, as coming from some
point on the Tehuantepec interoceanic route.<a id="FNanchor_VII-4" href="#Footnote_VII-4" class="fnanchor">[VII-4]</a></p>

<p>In the region of Petapa, a town forty or fifty miles
north of Tehuantepec, a stalactite cave is mentioned
by Brasseur, on the walls of which figures painted
in black are seen, including the imprint of human
hands like those on the Yucatan ruins except in
color. A labyrinth of caves, with some artificial
improvements, is also reported, where the remains of
princes and nobles were formerly deposited, and
where an arriero claims to have seen over one hundred
burial urns, painted and ranged in order round
the sides of the cave.<a id="FNanchor_VII-5" href="#Footnote_VII-5" class="fnanchor">[VII-5]</a> Only four leagues from Tehuantepec,
near Magdalena, Burgoa speaks of a
statue of Wixepecocha, the white-haired reformer
and prophet of the Zapotecs, which Brasseur, without
naming his authority, states to have been still
visible a few years before he wrote.<a id="FNanchor_VII-6" href="#Footnote_VII-6" class="fnanchor">[VII-6]</a> Lafond briefly
mentions three pyramids on the isthmus without definitely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
locating them;&mdash;that of Tehuantepec, seventy-two
feet high, that of San Cristóval near the former,
and that of Altamia in a broad plain.<a id="FNanchor_VII-7" href="#Footnote_VII-7" class="fnanchor">[VII-7]</a> At Laollaga,
seven leagues from Tehuantepec in a direction not
stated, Arias&mdash;very vaguely, as is the custom of
Mexican and Central American explorers of local
antiquities&mdash;describes a group of mounds, some of
which are seventy or eighty varas square, built of
stones&mdash;or stone adobes, as the author calls them&mdash;three
feet long and half as thick. In connection
with these mounds, flint and copper hatchets
have been found, together with many anchor-shaped
objects of what is spoken of as brass. A cave containing
some relics was reported to exist in the same
vicinity; and at another point, some fourteen leagues
from the city, is a mound seventy-five feet high, on
the side of which was discovered a black rock, covered
with hieroglyphic characters.<a id="FNanchor_VII-8" href="#Footnote_VII-8" class="fnanchor">[VII-8]</a> At Chihuitlan, a
day's journey from the city, a bridge of aboriginal
construction, stretches across a stream. The bridge
is twelve feet long, six feet wide, and nine feet high
above the water, having low parapets guarding the
sides. The conduit is nine feet wide, and is formed
by two immense stones, which meet in the centre.
According to Castañeda's drawing these two stones
have curved surfaces, so that the whole approaches in
form a regular arch. The whole structure is of the
class known as cyclopean, built of large irregular
stones, without mortar.<a id="FNanchor_VII-9" href="#Footnote_VII-9" class="fnanchor">[VII-9]</a></p>

<p>Respecting Tehuantepec antiquities, I have in addition
to what has been said only brief mention by
Garay of the following reported relics: On a cliff
of the Cerro del Venado, is the sculptured figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>
a deer, whence comes the name of the hill. Nine
miles east of the same hill the Indians pointed out
the location of a valley where they said were the
remains of a large town of stone buildings. The
Cerro de Coscomate, near Zanatepec, is said to have
a sculptured image of the sun, with an inscription in
unknown characters. And finally, relics have been
found on the islands of Monapostiac, Tilema, and
Arrianjianbaj; those on the first being in the form
of earthen idols, while in the latter were the foundations
of an aboriginal town.<a id="FNanchor_VII-10" href="#Footnote_VII-10" class="fnanchor">[VII-10]</a></p>

<p>At the port of Guatulco, south-west from Tehuantepec
on the Oajacan coast, there may yet be seen, if
Brasseur's statement is to be credited, traces of the
roads and buildings of the ancient city that stood in
this locality, and transmitted its name to the modern
town. Guatulco was likewise one of the many localities
described by the early Catholic writers as
containing a wonderful cross, left here probably by
Saint Thomas during his sojourn in America. We
are not very clearly informed as to the material of
this relic, but we know, from the same authorities,
that all the powers of darkness could not destroy it,
not even the famous Englishman, Sir Francis Drake,
who subjected it for three days to the fiercest flames
without affecting its condition. Brasseur also tells
us that the remains of Tututepec, a great aboriginal
south-coast capital, are still to be seen three or four
leagues from the sea, between the Rio Verde and
Lake Chicahua.<a id="FNanchor_VII-11" href="#Footnote_VII-11" class="fnanchor">[VII-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MISCELLANEOUS REMAINS.</p>

<p class="p2">Passing now to the interior valleys about the
capital city of Oajaca, where the chief remains of
aboriginal works are found, I shall mention first
a few miscellaneous relics of minor importance, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
at least only slightly known to explorers,<a id="FNanchor_VII-12" href="#Footnote_VII-12" class="fnanchor">[VII-12]</a> beginning
with the city of Oajaca, where Dupaix
found two ancient ornaments of great beauty. The
first was a pentagon of polished transparent agate,
about two inches in diameter and an inch and a half
thick. The surface bore no marks of the instruments
by which it was polished, and a hole was bored
through the stone presumably for the insertion of a
string. The second was a hexagonal piece of black
touch-stone, of about the same dimensions, sprinkled
with grains of gold or copper, and like the former
brilliantly polished. The hole in this stone was bored
in the form of a curve, by an unknown process which
must have been accompanied by no little difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_VII-13" href="#Footnote_VII-13" class="fnanchor">[VII-13]</a></p>

<p>At Tlacolula, some twenty miles south-east of
Oajaca, Mr Müller reports the opening of a mound
twelve feet high and eight feet in diameter at the
base. It was simply a heap of earth, and the only
artificially wrought objects found in the excavations
were an earthen tube two inches in diameter and
nearly two feet long, closed at each end with a stone
plug, found in a horizontal position somewhat above
the natural surface of the ground, and a bowl-shaped
ring of the same material lying in a vertical position
over the tube near the centre of the mound, but separated
from the first relic by a layer of earth.<a id="FNanchor_VII-14" href="#Footnote_VII-14" class="fnanchor">[VII-14]</a> Remains
of the ruined fortress of Quíyechapa are said
to have been seen by travelers at a point some twenty-five
leagues east of Oajaca.<a id="FNanchor_VII-15" href="#Footnote_VII-15" class="fnanchor">[VII-15]</a> At Etla, two leagues
northward from the capital, two subterranean tombs
were opened, and found to contain what are supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
to have been earthen torch-bearers, or images in distorted
human form, with a socket in the head which
indicates their former use. Similar images found at
Zachila will be noticed later in this chapter. A
wooden fac-simile of the tomb is mentioned by Sr
Gondra as preserved in the Mexican Museum.<a id="FNanchor_VII-16" href="#Footnote_VII-16" class="fnanchor">[VII-16]</a> At
Peñoles, seven leagues from Oajaca, a skull covered
and preserved by a coating of limestone was found.<a id="FNanchor_VII-17" href="#Footnote_VII-17" class="fnanchor">[VII-17]</a>
On the western boundary of this state, perhaps across
the line in Guerrero, at Quilapan, formerly a great
city of the Miztecs, an axe cast from red copper was
found, one fourth of an inch thick, four inches long,
and three and a half inches wide. From a mound
opened in the same vicinity some fragments of statues
and of pottery were taken.<a id="FNanchor_VII-18" href="#Footnote_VII-18" class="fnanchor">[VII-18]</a> Fossey tells us that
conical mounds in great numbers are scattered over
the whole country between Oajaca, Zachila, and Cuilapa.
The mounds are from fifteen to fifty feet high,
and are formed in some cases of simple earth, in
others of clay and stones. Human remains are found
often in the centre together with stone and earthen
figures. Those figures which are molded in human
form agree in features with the Zapotec features of
modern times. Copper mirrors and hatchets have
also been found, according to this author, as well as
golden ornaments and necklaces of gilded beads.<a id="FNanchor_VII-19" href="#Footnote_VII-19" class="fnanchor">[VII-19]</a>
M. Charnay saw in the second valley of Oajaca as he
came from Mexico the ruins of a temple, the building
of which was begun by the Spaniards in the time
of Cortés, on the site of an aboriginal temple. The
ruined walls of the latter were of adobes, and served
for scaffolding in the erection of the former, and both
ruins now stand together. The whole valley was covered
with tumuli, probably tombs, as the author thinks;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>
but the natives would neither help to make excavations
nor permit strangers to make them.<a id="FNanchor_VII-20" href="#Footnote_VII-20" class="fnanchor">[VII-20]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the relics described in the few and
unsatisfactory notes of the preceding pages, three important
groups of antiquities in central Oajaca remain
to be noticed: Monte Alban, Zachila, and Mitla; our
information respecting the two former being also far
from satisfactory.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF MONTE ALBAN.</p>

<p class="p2">Monte Alban is located immediately west of the
city of Oajaca, or Antequera, at a distance of from
half a mile to five miles according to different authorities.
These differences in the statements of the distance
perhaps result from the fact that some visitors
estimate it in an air line, while others include the
windings of the road which must be traveled over a
mountainous country in order to reach the ruins,
which seem to be located on a high hill or on a range
of hills overlooking the town. Dupaix and Castañeda
visited this place during their second expedition.
Juan B. Carriedo made in 1833 a manuscript atlas of
plans and drawings of the remains, which has never
been published, but which is said to be preserved in
the Mexican Museum. José María García explored
Monte Alban in 1855, and his report with some
drawings was published in the bulletin of the Mexican
Geographical Society. Müller, the German traveler,
visited the place in 1857 with one Ortega, and
published a plan in his work. Finally we have Charnay's
description from an exploration in 1858 or 1859,
unaccompanied, however, by photographic views.<a id="FNanchor_VII-21" href="#Footnote_VII-21" class="fnanchor">[VII-21]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i378"></a>
<img src="images/i378.jpg" width="317" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Plan of Ruins&mdash;Monte Alban.</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this array of authorities, which
ought to give a clear idea of a single group of remains,
the reader will find the following description
very imperfect, since each of the visitors, as a rule,
describes a different part of the ruins, and they do not
often agree in their remarks on any one structure.
The plan in the annexed cut is copied from that in
Müller's work, and shows all the remains marked on
the original, except four small structures on a northern
continuation of the hill, or spur, <i>a</i>, shown in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
north-eastern part of the plan. As the plan indicates,
the ruins are situated on a plateau of some three
hundred by nine hundred yards along the summit of
a range of high hills with precipitous ascent, rising
from the banks of a stream which Müller calls the
Rio Xoxo. The works mentioned as not included in
the plan, are described by Müller as the remains of
four walls which form a parallelogram. All he tells
us of the works at <i>d</i> and <i>f</i>, is that the terraces are
covered with walls and embankments parallel or at
right angles to each other. The structure at <i>c</i> is
described as a pyramidal elevation fifty feet high and
two hundred and fifty varas square at the base, from
the summit platform of which rise a smaller terrace,
or mound, at the north-west corner, and various other
embankments and ruined walls not particularly described,
but indicated on the plan. The structures in the
central portion of the main plateau, at <i>h</i>, are spoken
of as parallel embankments about thirty feet high.</p>

<p>To the ruins thus far mentioned no one but Müller
refers definitely, although others speak somewhat
vaguely of the ruined embankments and walls that
cover the whole surface of the plateau. Only the
southern remains at <i>e</i> seem to have attracted the
attention of all. These Müller briefly represents as
an embankment fifty feet high, enclosing a quadrilateral
space, on which embankment were two pyramids
or mounds. One of the latter was proved by
excavating to have no interior apartments or galleries;
the other was penetrated at the base by
galleries at right angles with each other, and leading
to a central dome-shaped room, the top of which had
fallen. García represents the square court as enclosed,
not by a continuous embankment, but by four
long mounds, having a slight space between them at
the ends. The southern mound is the largest of the
four, being about forty-five feet high, and, according
to García's plan, about twelve hundred feet long and
three hundred feet wide. It seems, from the drawings,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
to be nothing but a simple heap of earth and
rough stones, although the slopes of the sides and ends
were doubtless regular originally, perhaps even faced
with masonry, and there are traces of a stairway
leading up to the summit platform from the court. On
the summit of the mounds, and also in the court, are
many conical mounds, four of which were particularly
noticed. These mounds were the only remains on the
plateau of Monte Alban which attracted the attention
of Dupaix and Castañeda, and are represented by them
as heaps of rough stones, in some cases with mortar,
covered on the exterior with cement, and traversed at
the base by galleries, the sides of which are faced with
hewn blocks. García says the mounds are about
twenty-four feet high; but Dupaix calls one forty
feet, another sixty, and a third still higher.</p>

<p>One of the mounds stands at the head of the stairway
from the court, and the gallery through it at the
base is described by García as having a bend in the
centre, being six feet high, wide enough for two persons,
and according to the plate, surmounted by large
inclined blocks of stone resting against each other and
forming an angle at the summit. Dupaix describes
one of the mounds as traversed from north to south
by a gallery nine feet high and six feet wide, which
makes a turn, or elbow, near the centre, thus forming
a room about twelve feet square and of the same
height. The two mounds may very likely be identical,
for although Castañeda's plate represents a regular
curved arch, Kingsborough's copy has the pointed
arch of large stones. Another of these artificial stone
hills, according to Dupaix, has in the centre a room
eighteen feet square, and thirty feet high, with a semicircular
or dome-like top, the surface being formed of
hewn stone. From the centre of each side a gallery
thirty feet long, seven and a half feet high, and four
feet and a half wide, with a regular arch, leads to the
open air. The whole is said to be built on a large
rectangular base of masonry, the dimensions of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
are not given. García mentions a similar mound, but
speaks of the central room as being circular.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i381"></a>
<img src="images/i381.jpg" width="271" height="270" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Sculptured Profile from Monte Alban.</p>
</div>

<p>Another of these structures, resembling at the time
of Dupaix's visit a natural hill covered with trees, is
sixty feet high, and has a gallery seven and a half feet
high and six feet wide, with arched top, extending
seventy-eight feet, or nearly the whole diameter from
south to north. The left hand, or western, wall of the
gallery is composed of granite blocks, generally about
twenty-eight by thirty-six inches and eighteen inches
thick, on the surface of which are sculptured naked
human figures in profile facing northward toward the
interior of the mound. Four of these figures were
sketched by Castañeda, and one of them, from whose
head hangs something very like a Chinese queue, is
shown in the cut. García locates this mound or another
very similar one in the court, and he also
sketched some of the figures, but very slight if any
resemblance can be discovered between his drawings
and those of Castañeda. Müller speaks of one of the
tablets the sculptured design of which represents a
woman giving birth to a ball. García states that human
bones and fragments of pottery have been dug
from these ruins, Dupaix found some bones, and M.
Lenoir suggests that the figures in bas-relief were portraits
of persons buried in the tombs. Dupaix mentions

a fourth mound similar to the others, having an
angular ceiling, and a pavement of lime and sand.</p>

<p>Charnay describes the plateau as being partially
artificial, and as covering about one half a square
league, covered with masses of stone and mortar,
forts, esplanades, narrow subterranean passages, and
immense sculptured blocks. The arches of the galleries,
contrary to Dupaix's statements, are formed
by large inclined blocks. The grandest ruins are at
the south end of the plateau; they are mostly square
truncated pyramids, about twenty-five feet high, and
having steep sides. Enormous masses of masonry
represent what once were palaces, temples, and forts.<a id="FNanchor_VII-22" href="#Footnote_VII-22" class="fnanchor">[VII-22]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS AT MONTE ALBAN.</p>

<p>Three smooth cubical stones, seven and a half feet
high, four and a half feet wide, and eighteen inches
thick, of granite, according to García, but of red
porphyry, in the opinion of Müller, were found
during the ascent of the hill, perhaps at <i>b</i>, or <i>g</i>, of
the plan. Two of the stones were standing close
together, while the third had fallen; all are supposed
to have formed an altar or pedestal.<a id="FNanchor_VII-23" href="#Footnote_VII-23" class="fnanchor">[VII-23]</a> At the southern
brink of the plateau Müller found a crumbling
stone covered with hieroglyphics. On the slope of
the hill, stones covered with sculptured hieroglyphics
were noticed by Dupaix, also at the western base
long cubes, some plain and others sculptured. One
of the latter six feet long, four feet and a half wide,
and eighteen inches thick, was sketched by Castañeda,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
together with a circular stone three varas and
a half in circumference. His plates also include a
semi-spherical mirror of copper-covered lava, three
and a half inches in diameter, with beautifully polished
surface and a hole drilled through the back; a
copper chisel, seven inches long and one inch in diameter;
and finally, the cast copper implement shown in
the preceding cut, one of two hundred and seventy-six
of the same form, but of slightly varying dimensions,
which were found in an earthen jar dug up in this
vicinity. The dimensions of the one shown in the
cut are about eight by ten inches. Pieces of copper
of this form were used by the Nahua peoples for
money, and such was doubtless the purpose of these
Oajacan relics. A precisely similar article from one
of the Mexican ruins lies before me as I write.
Charnay states that the plateau is covered with fragments
of very fine pottery, on which a brilliant red
glazing is observable. He states further, that an
Italian explorer, opening some of the mounds, found
necklaces of agate, fragments of worked obsidian, and
even golden ornaments of fine workmanship.</p>

<p>Respecting these ruins Charnay says: "Monte Alban,
in our opinion, is one of the most precious remains,
and very surely the most ancient, of the American
civilizations. Nowhere else have we found these
strange profiles so strikingly original." He pronounces
the arch similar to that employed in Yucatan,
but this opinion does not agree with his description
on another page, where he represents the ceilings of
the galleries as formed of large inclined blocks of
stone. Viollet-le-Duc gives a cut indicating the latter
form of arch; and I think there can be no doubt
that Dupaix and Castañeda are wrong in representing
semicircular arches. M. Viollet-le-Duc deems the
sculpture different in type from that at Palenque but
very similar to the Egyptian. He regards the works
as fortifications and speaks of the galleries as penetrating
the ramparts. Müller and García also deem
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
the remains those of fortifications, while Ortega seeks
to form them into a stately capital full of royal palaces,
temples, and fine edifices. García tells us that
these works were erected by a Zapotec king, with a
view to resist the advance of the Miztecs; while Brasseur
believes that here was the fortress of Huaxyacac
built by the Aztecs about the year 1486, and garrisoned
to keep the country in subjection.<a id="FNanchor_VII-24" href="#Footnote_VII-24" class="fnanchor">[VII-24]</a></p>

<p>It seems to me that the preceding description, imperfect
as it is, is yet more than sufficient to prove
that the structures on Monte Alban were never
erected by any people as temporary works of defense.
The choice of location shows, however, that facility
of defense was one of the objects sought by the builders,
and renders it very improbable that a city proper
ever stood here, where, at least in modern times, there
are no springs of water. On the other hand, the conical
mounds as represented by Castañeda's drawings
seem in no way fitted for defensive works, and were
almost certainly erected as tombs of Zapotec nobles
or priests. The plateau was probably in aboriginal
times a strongly fortified holy place, sacred to the
rites of the native worship, but serving perhaps as a
place of refuge to the dwellers in the surrounding
country when threatened by an advancing foe. It is
moreover very likely that in the period of civil strifes
and foreign invasions which preceded the Spanish
Conquest, these works were strengthened and occupied
by the Zapotecs, and possibly by the Aztecs also
in their turn, as a fortress.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RELICS AT ZACHILA.</p>

<p class="p2">Zachila, ten or twelve miles, according to the maps,
southward from Oajaca, was the site of a great Zapotec
capital. A writer in a Mexican magazine mentions
the base of an ancient pyramid as still visible
near the church of the modern town. With the exception
of this brief mention all our information
respecting the antiquities of Zachila comes from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
work of Dupaix; and this writer, so far as permanent
monuments are concerned, only speaks generally of
an immense group of mounds in conical form, built of
earth and a few stones, and of the imprint of a gigantic
foot probably marking the meridian somewhat south
of the mounds. From excavations in these tumuli,
stone and clay statues, or idols, were obtained, together
with pottery, burnt bricks, pieces of human bones, and
fragments of ruined walls. Of the objects taken from
the tumuli or found in the vicinity, over twenty were
described and sketched by Dupaix and Castañeda.</p>

</div>

<p>1. A seated human figure with arms and legs
crossed as shown in the cut. It is carved from a grayish
yellow grindstone-like material, and is about a foot
in height. It was found in a tomb together with
some human bones. The rear view in the original
shows the hair falling down the back and cut square
across; while the belt about the waist is passed between
the legs and is tied in a knot behind. 2. A
seated human figure in granite, eighteen inches high.
The arms, from elbow to wrist, are free from the body,
and the hands rest on the knees. A string of beads
or pearls is suspended from the neck, and a mask with
fantastic figures in relief covers the face. In the top
of the head is a hollow, and the image seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
been designed, like many others in the same locality,
for a vase or, perhaps, a torch-bearer. 3. A seated
human figure, twenty-seven inches high, cut from
white marble and painted red. The arms and body
are concealed by a kind of semicircular cape. The
hands appear below the cape, holding some indescribable
object. A necklace of beads or pearls surrounds
the neck, the face is apparently masked or at least the
features are ideally fantastic, and an immense headdress,
as large as all the rest of the figure, surmounts
the whole in semicircular form. A serpent
appears among the emblems of the head-dress.<a id="FNanchor_VII-25" href="#Footnote_VII-25" class="fnanchor">[VII-25]</a> 4.
A stone twenty-seven inches long, twelve inches
high, and three inches thick, of very hard and heavy
material. On one side, within a plain border, are
four human figures in low relief, two on each side
facing a kind of altar in the middle. All are squatting
cross-legged, one has clearly a beard, and another
has a bird&mdash;called by Dupaix an eagle, as is his custom
respecting every bird-like sculpture&mdash;forming a
part of his head-dress. The stone was badly broken,
but seems to have been carried by the finder to Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_VII-26" href="#Footnote_VII-26" class="fnanchor">[VII-26]</a>
5. A bird bearing considerable likeness to an
eagle, holding a serpent in its beak and claws. This
figure was sculptured in low relief on a block of hard
sandstone three feet square, built into a modern wall.
6. A human face, much like what is in modern times
drawn to represent the full moon, three feet in diameter,
and also built into a wall. The material is a
brilliant gray marble. 7. Three fragments with
sculptured surfaces, one of which has among other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
figures several that seem to represent flowers. 8, 9.
Two masked images, similar in some respects to No.
2, but of terra-cotta instead of stone. One of them
is shown in the cut. They are about a foot and a
half high, hollow, and present some indications, in
the form of a socket at the back of the head, of having
been intended to hold torches.<a id="FNanchor_VII-27" href="#Footnote_VII-27" class="fnanchor">[VII-27]</a> 10. A terra-cotta
figure, about nine inches high, apparently representing
a female clad in a very peculiar dress, as
shown in the cut.<a id="FNanchor_VII-28" href="#Footnote_VII-28" class="fnanchor">[VII-28]</a> 11. An earthen cylinder, five
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
inches in diameter and nine inches high, on the top
of which is a head, possibly the caricature of a dog,
from whose open jaws looks out a tolerably well-formed
human face. 12-17. Six heads of animals or
monsters in terra cotta. 18-23. Six earthen dishes
of various forms, one of which, in the form of a
platter, has within it a representation in clay of a
human skull.</p>

<p>A tomb is said to have been opened at Zachila in
which were several tiers of earthen platters, each containing
a skull. Some of the vessels have hollow legs
with small balls, which rattle when they are moved.<a id="FNanchor_VII-29" href="#Footnote_VII-29" class="fnanchor">[VII-29]</a>
At Cuilapa, some distance north-east of Zachila, the
existence of tumuli is mentioned, but a German explorer,
who visited the locality with a view to open
some of them, is said to have been stoned and driven
away by the infuriated natives, notwithstanding the
fact that he was provided with authority from the
local authorities.<a id="FNanchor_VII-30" href="#Footnote_VII-30" class="fnanchor">[VII-30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MITLA&mdash;HOME OF THE DEAD.</p>

<p class="p2">The finest and most celebrated group of ruins in
Oajaca, probably the finest in the whole Nahua territory,
is that at Mitla, about thirty miles slightly
south of east from the capital, and eight or nine miles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
north-east of Tlacolula. Here was a great religious
centre often mentioned in the traditional annals of the
Zapotecs. The original name seems to have been
Liobaa, or Yobaa, 'the place of tombs,' called by the
Aztecs Miquitlan, Mictlan, or Mitla, 'place of sadness,'
'dwelling of the dead,' often used in the sense
of 'hell.'<a id="FNanchor_VII-31" href="#Footnote_VII-31" class="fnanchor">[VII-31]</a> The buildings at Mitla were at least partially
in ruins when the Spaniards came, but their dilapidation
probably dated only from the fierce contests
waged by the Zapotec kings against the Aztec
powers in Anáhuac, during one or two centuries preceding
the Conquest; and as we shall see later there
is no reason whatever to doubt that the place was
occupied by the Zapotec priesthood during the long
period of that nation's supremacy in Oajaca and the
southern Anáhuac.<a id="FNanchor_VII-32" href="#Footnote_VII-32" class="fnanchor">[VII-32]</a></p>

<p>The gloomy aspect of the locality accords well with
the dread signification of its name. The ruins stand
in the most desolate portion of central Oajaca, in a
high, narrow valley, surrounded by bare and barren
hills. The soil is a powdery sand, which supports no
vegetation save a few scattered pitahayas, and is borne
through the air in clouds of dust by the cold dry
wind which is almost continually blowing. A stream
with parched and shadeless banks flows through the
valley, becoming a torrent in the rainy season, when
the adjoining country is often flooded. No birds sing
or flowers bloom over the remains of the Zapotec heroes,
but venomous spiders and scorpions are abundant. Yet
a modern village with few inhabitants stands amid the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
ruins, and the natives go through forms of worship in
honor of a foreign deity in a modern church over the
tombs of their ancestors' kings and priests, whose
faith they were long since forced to abandon.<a id="FNanchor_VII-33" href="#Footnote_VII-33" class="fnanchor">[VII-33]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">EXPLORATION OF MITLA.</p>

<p>Most of the early Spanish chroniclers speak of
Mitla and of the traditions connected with the place,
but what may be called the modern exploration of the
structures, as relics of antiquity, dates from the year
1802, when Don Luis Martin and Col. de la Laguna
from Mexico visited and sketched the ruins. It was
from Martin and from his drawings in the hands of
the Marquis of Branciforte, that Humboldt obtained
his information. In August 1806, Dupaix and Castañeda
reached Mitla in their second exploring tour.
In 1830, the German traveler Mühlenpfordt, during
a residence in the country, made plans and drawings
of the remains, copies of which were retained by Juan
B. Carriedo and afterwards published in a Mexican
periodical. Drawings were also made by one Sawkins
in 1837, and published by Mr Brantz Mayer in
a work on Zapotec antiquities. M. de Fossey was at
Mitla in 1838, but his description is made up chiefly
from other sources. Sr Carriedo, already mentioned,
wrote for the <i><span xml:lang="es">Ilustracion Mejicana</span></i>, a statement of the
condition of the ruins in 1852, with measures which
had been, or ought to be, taken by the government
for their preservation. Mr Arthur von Tempsky
spent part of a day at the ruins in February, 1854,
publishing a description with several plates in the
account of his Mexican travels which he named
<i>Mitla</i>. José María García saw the ruins in October,
1855, as is stated in the bulletin of the Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Geographical Society, but no description resulted from
his exploration. Finally Charnay came in 1859, and
succeeded after many difficulties in obtaining a series
of most valuable and interesting photographs.<a id="FNanchor_VII-34" href="#Footnote_VII-34" class="fnanchor">[VII-34]</a></p>

<img src="images/i392.jpg" width="332" height="519" alt="" />
<p class="caption">General Plan of Mitla.</p>
</div>

<p>The number of ruined edifices at Mitla is variously
stated by different authors, according to their methods
of counting; for instance, one explorer reckons four
buildings enclosing a court as one palace, another as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
four. The only general plan ever published is that
made by Mühlenpfordt, and published by Carriedo,
from which the annexed cut was prepared.<a id="FNanchor_VII-35" href="#Footnote_VII-35" class="fnanchor">[VII-35]</a> Most of
the visitors, however, say something of the bearing of
some of the buildings from the others, and there are
only very few instances where such remarks seem to
differ from the plan I have given. The structures
usually spoken of as palaces or temples, are four in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>
number, marked 1, 2, 3, and 4; 5 and 7 are pyramids,
mounds, or altars; and 6 shows the position of the
houses in the modern village.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i393"></a>
<img src="images/i393.jpg" width="361" height="447" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Ground Plan of Palace No. 1.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">GRAND PALACE.</p>

<p>I begin with the best preserved of all, palace
No. 1 of the plan.<a id="FNanchor_VII-36" href="#Footnote_VII-36" class="fnanchor">[VII-36]</a> The arrangement of its three
buildings is shown in the accompanying ground
plan, a reduction from Castañeda's drawing. Three
low oblong mounds, probably of rough stones, only
five or six feet high, enclose on the east, north, and
west, a court, E, whose dimensions are in general
terms one hundred and twenty by one hundred and
thirty feet, and each of the mounds supports a stone
building. The walls of the northern building are
still in a tolerable state of preservation; the eastern
one has mostly fallen, and of that on the west only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
slight traces of the foundations remain. It is possible
that originally there was a fourth mound, with
or without its building, on the south.<a id="FNanchor_VII-37" href="#Footnote_VII-37" class="fnanchor">[VII-37]</a></p>

<p>The lateral buildings, <i>d</i>, <i>j</i>, are about nineteen by
ninety-six feet on the ground. Of the northern
building, the southern portion, A, is about thirty-six
by a hundred and thirty feet, the northern portion, C,
sixty-one feet square, and the whole not far from
eighteen feet high, the walls being from four to nine
feet in thickness.<a id="FNanchor_VII-38" href="#Footnote_VII-38" class="fnanchor">[VII-38]</a> Other details will be readily
learned from the plan. Three doorways open on the
court from each building, and a broad stairway of few
steps leads up to the doorways, at least on the north.</p>

<p>The southern wing of the northern building, A of
the plan, may be first described, being the best
known and one of the best preserved of all; and the
structure of the walls naturally claims attention first.
In Yucatan we have found a filling of rough stones
and cement, faced on both exterior and interior with
hewn blocks; at Palenque the walls are built entirely
of hewn stone; at Mitla the mode of construction
somewhat resembles that in Yucatan, but the
filling seems to be clay, instead of cement, with an
admixture of irregular stones, varying in quantity in
different parts of the walls.<a id="FNanchor_VII-39" href="#Footnote_VII-39" class="fnanchor">[VII-39]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CONSTRUCTION OF WALLS.</p>

<p>The exterior facing of the wall is shown very
clearly by the two following cuts, which represent
the southern façade of the building, A, as seen from
the court. The first cut I have reduced photographically
from Charnay's original photograph; the
second, showing the rest of the façade, was taken
from the same photograph for Mr Baldwin's work.
The facing is of stone blocks cut in different forms
and sizes, placed against or in some cases slightly
penetrating the inner filling. First, a double tier of
very large blocks are placed as a base along the surface
of the supporting mound, projecting two or three
feet from the line of the wall, the stones of the upper
tier sloping inward. On this base is erected a kind
of frame-work of large hewn blocks with perfectly
plain unsculptured fronts, which divide the surface of
the wall into oblong panels of different dimensions.
These panels are then filled with a peculiar mosaic
work of small brick-shaped blocks of stone of different
sizes, set in different positions, so as to form a
great variety of regular patterns, usually spoken of as
grecques.<a id="FNanchor_VII-40" href="#Footnote_VII-40" class="fnanchor">[VII-40]</a> No mortar seems to have been employed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
in this facing of stone; at least its use is not mentioned
by any author, and Dupaix states expressly
that it is not found. Some of the blocks used in the
base, frame-work of the panels, and lintels of the
doorways, are very large. One of the latter is described
by different writers as from sixteen to nineteen
feet long, and is said by Dupaix to be of granite.
The only sculpture on the façade is found on these
lintels, the surface of which is represented as carved
into regular figures in low relief, corresponding with
the mosaic in the panels. The doorways are about
seven feet wide and eight feet high, and in the upper
part of the piers that separate them are noticed four
round holes, which may be supposed, as in other aboriginal
structures, to have served for the support of
an awning, although the natives have a tradition that
they were originally occupied by stone heads of native
deities.<a id="FNanchor_VII-41" href="#Footnote_VII-41" class="fnanchor">[VII-41]</a> The only other peculiarity to be noticed in
this front is, that instead of being perpendicular, it
inclines slightly outward from the base, as do many
of the walls at Mitla.<a id="FNanchor_VII-42" href="#Footnote_VII-42" class="fnanchor">[VII-42]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">STONE COLUMNS.</p>

<p>The interior of the building, A, has a pavement of
flat stones covered with cement, which latter has
mostly disappeared. The inner surface of the walls
is of rough stones and earth, probably the same as
the interior filling, and covered with a coat of plaster,
a greater part of which remained in 1859, and is
shown in Charnay's photograph; there were also
traces of red paint on these walls in Dupaix's time.
There are no windows, or other openings except the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>
doorways; but on the northern wall, at mid-height,
there is a niche, perhaps more than one, one or two
feet deep, square in form, and enclosed by four blocks
of stone. Extending in a line along the centre of
this apartment, are six round stone pillars, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, of
the plan, each about fourteen feet high, three feet in
diameter, and cut from a single block of porphyry or
granite. The tops are slightly smaller than the
bases, and five or six feet of each stone, in addition
to the height mentioned, are buried in the ground.<a id="FNanchor_VII-43" href="#Footnote_VII-43" class="fnanchor">[VII-43]</a></p>

<p>The following cut I take from Baldwin's work, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>
which it was copied from one of Tempsky's plates.
It is very faulty, as is proved by Charnay's photograph
taken from the same point of view, in representing
the walls as if built of large rough stones without
mortar, in putting a doorway in the central part of
the northern wall, and in making the columns diminish
in size towards the top much more than is
actually the case.<a id="FNanchor_VII-44" href="#Footnote_VII-44" class="fnanchor">[VII-44]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSAIC GRECQUES AT MITLA.</p>

<p>Passing now to the northern wing of this building,
C, the exterior walls are the same in style and construction
as those of the southern wing just described,
as is proved by the photographic views.<a id="FNanchor_VII-45" href="#Footnote_VII-45" class="fnanchor">[VII-45]</a> The court,
C, is about thirty-one feet square, and its pavement
was covered with cement, as that of the larger court,
E, may have been originally. The ground plan shows
the arrangement of the four apartments, b, b, b, b,
although it is to be noted that other plans differ
slightly from this in the northern and western rooms.
The only entrance to the northern court and rooms is
from the southern wing through the passage <i>f, f</i>,
which is barely wide enough to admit one person.
The interior façades, fronting on the court, are precisely
like the southern façade of the southern wing,
A, being made up of mosaic work in panels.<a id="FNanchor_VII-46" href="#Footnote_VII-46" class="fnanchor">[VII-46]</a> The
interior walls of the small apartments, b, b, b, b, unlike
those of the southern apartment, A, are formed
of mosaic work in regular and graceful patterns, except
a space of four or five feet at the bottom, which
is covered with plaster and bears traces of a kind of
fresco painting in bright colors. The mosaic grecques
or arabesques of the upper portions are arranged, not
in panels as on the exterior, but in three parallel
bands of uniform and nearly equal width, extending
round the whole circumference of each room. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
cut is a fac-simile from Charnay's photograph of one
of these interiors, and gives an excellent idea of the
three mosaic bands that extend entirely round each
room.<a id="FNanchor_VII-47" href="#Footnote_VII-47" class="fnanchor">[VII-47]</a></p>

<p>I now have to speak of the roof which originally
covered this building, since in the other buildings and
palaces nothing will be found to throw any additional
light on the subject. It seems evident that the columns
in the southern wing were intended to support
the roof, and if there were no contradictory evidence,
the natural conclusion would be that the covering
was of wooden beams stretching completely across
the narrow apartments, and resting on the pillars of
the wider ones, as we have seen to be the case at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Tuloom, on the eastern coast of Yucatan.<a id="FNanchor_VII-48" href="#Footnote_VII-48" class="fnanchor">[VII-48]</a> Burgoa,
in whose time it is not impossible that some of the
roofs may have been yet in place, tells us that they
were formed of large stone blocks, resting on the
columns, and joined without mortar.<a id="FNanchor_VII-49" href="#Footnote_VII-49" class="fnanchor">[VII-49]</a> Humboldt
states that the roof was supported by large <i>sabino</i>
beams, and that three of these beams still remained
in place (1802). According to Dupaix, both the
roofs and floors in the northern wing were formed by
a row of beams, or rather logs, of the <i>ahuehuete</i>, a
kind of pine, a foot and a half in diameter, built into
the top of the wall, and stretching from side to side.
He does not inform us what traces he found to support
his opinion. Mühlenpfordt<a id="FNanchor_VII-50" href="#Footnote_VII-50" class="fnanchor">[VII-50]</a> found traces of a
roof in one of the northern rooms sufficient to convince
him that the original "consisted of round oak
timbers, eight inches in diameter, placed across the
room at a distance of eight inches one from another;
these were first covered with mats, on which were
placed stone flags, and over the latter a coat of lime;
forming thus a solid and water-proof covering."
Fossey speaks of one worm-eaten beam, but probably
obtained his information from Humboldt. Tempsky,
notwithstanding the shortness of his exploration,
made the remarkable discovery that one of the northern
rooms was still covered by a flat roof of stone.
He also found windows in some of the buildings.
What would he not have found had he been able to
remain a few hours longer at Mitla? Viollet-le-Duc
judges from the quantity and quality of the débris in
the south wing, that the roof could not have been of
stone in large blocks, but was formed by large beams
extending longitudinally from pillar to pillar, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
supporting two transverse ranges of smaller timbers,
laid close together from the centre to either wall, the
whole being surmounted by a mass of concrete like
that which constitutes the bulk of the walls; and
finally covered with a coating of cement. I have no
doubt that this author has given a correct idea of the
original roof structure, although in attempting to explain
in detail the exact position which&mdash;'<span xml:lang="fr">il y a tout
lieu de croire</span>'&mdash;each timber occupied, it is possible
that the distinguished architect has gone somewhat
beyond his data.<a id="FNanchor_VII-51" href="#Footnote_VII-51" class="fnanchor">[VII-51]</a></p>

<p class="caption">View from Court of Palace No. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>As I have said before, the western building of the
palace No. 1&mdash;like the southern building, if any ever
stood on the south of the court&mdash;has entirely fallen.
Of the eastern building, <i>d</i>, there remain standing a
small portion of the wall fronting on the court, including
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
a doorway and its lintel, and also two of the
five columns which occupied the centre of the building.
The condition of this side structure seems not
to have changed materially between Dupaix's and
Charnay's visits, a period of over fifty years. The
preceding cut, taken by Baldwin from Tempsky's
work, gives a tolerably correct idea of what remains
of it, except that the lintel had a sculptured front.
It is a view from the south side of the court, and includes
an imperfect representation also of the northern
façade.<a id="FNanchor_VII-52" href="#Footnote_VII-52" class="fnanchor">[VII-52]</a></p>

<p>The palaces of Mitla are differently numbered by
different writers, and much that has been written of
them is so vague or confused that is difficult to determine
in many cases what particular structure is
referred to; I believe, however, that the preceding
pages include all that is known of the palace numbered
1 on my general plan. I close my account of
this palace by presenting on the opposite page a cut
copied for Baldwin's work from one of Charnay's
photographs, a general view of the ruins. The cut
is a distant view of the palace No. 1 from the south-west,
and cannot be said to add very materially to
our knowledge respecting this building.<a id="FNanchor_VII-53" href="#Footnote_VII-53" class="fnanchor">[VII-53]</a>

<p class="sidenote">THE SECOND PALACE.</p>

<p>The remaining palaces of Mitla, Nos. 2, 3, and 4,
may be more briefly disposed of, since in the construction
of their walls they are precisely the same as No.
1, but are not in so good a state of preservation. No.
2 is located south-west of No. 1, and almost in contact
with it, so that both groups have been by some
visitors described together under the name of First
Palace. It consists of four buildings, built on low
mounds like those of No. 1, from seven to nine feet
high, about a square court. All four are precisely
the same in their ground plan, which is identical with
that of the western building in palace No. 1. The
dimensions of the four buildings are also the same,
according to Castañeda's plan, being about eighteen
by ninety-two English feet;<a id="FNanchor_VII-54" href="#Footnote_VII-54" class="fnanchor">[VII-54]</a> but Mühlenpfordt's plan,
so far as it can be understood, makes the eastern and
western buildings about one hundred and forty feet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>
long, the northern and southern being about twenty
by one hundred feet, and the former somewhat larger
than the latter.</p>

<p>The western building is the best preserved, being,
so far as can be judged by human figures in Charnay's
photographs, about seventeen feet high. The
eastern building has fallen, and only its foundation
stones remain by which to trace its plan. Three
doorways open on the court from each building, and
in the rear wall opposite the doors square niches are
seen. There are no traces of columns in any of the
apartments; nor was any part of the roofs in place in
1806. The outer walls are composed, as in palace
No. 1, of oblong panels of mosaic; whether any mosaic
work is found in the interior, is not stated. The
court is said by Mühlenpfordt to be covered with a
coating of cement five or six inches in thickness,
painted red as was also the exterior of the buildings.
The same writer, and Müller, noted that the supporting
mounds were double, or terraced, on the exterior;<a id="FNanchor_VII-55" href="#Footnote_VII-55" class="fnanchor">[VII-55]</a>
and the latter, that one of the central doorways
diminishes in width towards the top. If this, latter
statement be true, it must be one of the doorways in
the southern building, of which no photographic view
was taken.<a id="FNanchor_VII-56" href="#Footnote_VII-56" class="fnanchor">[VII-56]</a> Views of the southern façade of the
northern building are given by Charnay, Dupaix,
Mühlenpfordt, and Tempsky; of the court façade of
the western building, by Charnay and Mühlenpfordt;
and Charnay also took photographs of the western
and southern façades of the latter building.<a id="FNanchor_VII-57" href="#Footnote_VII-57" class="fnanchor">[VII-57]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Under the northern building of this palace there
is a subterranean gallery in the form of a cross. The
entrance to this gallery is said by several writers to
have been originally in the centre of the court, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>
this seems to rest on no very good authority, and it is
not unlikely that the entrance was always where it is
now, at the base of the northern mound, as shown in
the photograph and in other views. The centre of
the cross may be supposed to be nearly under the
centre of the apartment above, and the northern,
eastern, and western arms are each, according to Castañeda's
drawings, about twelve feet long, five and a
half feet wide, and six and a half feet high. The
southern arm, leading out into the court is something
over twenty feet long, and for most of its length only
a little over four feet high; its floor is also several
feet lower than that of the other arms, to the level
of which latter four steps lead up. Nearly the whole
depth of this gallery is probably in the body of the
supporting mound rather than really subterranean.
The top is formed of large blocks of stone, stretching
across from side to side, and, according to Mühlenpfordt,
plastered and polished. The floor was also
covered, if we may credit Müller, with a polished
coat of cement. The walls are panels of mosaic work
like that found on the exterior walls above. Mühlenpfordt
noticed that the mosaic work was less skillfully
executed than on the upper walls, and therefore probably
much older. The large dall that covers the
crossing of the two galleries is supported by a circular
pillar resting on a square base. According to
Tempsky the natives call this the 'pillar of death,'
believing that whoever embraces it must die shortly.
The whole interior surface, sides, floor, and ceiling,
are painted red. No relics of any kind have been
found here. Fossey says that this gallery, or at least
<i>a</i> gallery, leads from the palace to the eastern pyramid&mdash;meaning
probably the western pyramid, No. 5
of the plan&mdash;and from that point still further westward,
where it may be traced for a league to the farm
of Saga, and extends, as the natives believe, some
three hundred leagues. Tradition relates that the
Zapotecs originally had their temples in natural caverns,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
which they gradually improved to meet their
requirements, and over which they finally built these
palaces. There are consequently many absurd rumors
afloat respecting the extent of the subterranean passages,
but nothing has ever been discovered to indicate
the existence of natural caves or extensive artificial
excavations at this point. At the time of
Charnay's visit the opening to the gallery had been
closed up, and the natives would allow no one to remove
the obstructions, on the ground that hidden
treasure was the object sought.<a id="FNanchor_VII-58" href="#Footnote_VII-58" class="fnanchor">[VII-58]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THIRD PALACE.</p>

<p>Palace No. 3 of the plan is said to have no supporting
mound, but to stand on the level of the
ground. Its ground plan, according to Castañeda,
the only authority, is shown in the cut. The whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
structure, divided into three courts, is about two
hundred and eighty-four feet long and one hundred
and eight feet wide, the thickness of the walls, not
shown in the plan, being five or six feet. Nearly all
the walls have fallen except those of the buildings
about the central court, B, which have been repaired,
covered with a roof of tiles, and are occupied by the
curate of the parish as a residence. In the western
front a doorway has been cut, before which, supporting
a balcony, or awning, stand two stone columns
which were evidently brought from some other part
of the ruins. Both on the exterior and court walls,
the regular panels of mosaic work are seen in the
upper portions; the lower parts have been repaired
with adobes, and newly plastered in many places.
The modern church, quite a large and imposing structure,
stands either upon or adjacent to a part of this
ancient palace.<a id="FNanchor_VII-59" href="#Footnote_VII-59" class="fnanchor">[VII-59]</a></p>

<p>The cut is a ground plan of palace No. 4, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
also said to stand on the original level of the ground.
The walls are spoken of by all visitors as almost entirely
in ruins, and as presenting no peculiarities of
construction when compared with the other palaces.
From one of the portions still standing, however,
Mühlenpfordt copied some fragmentary paintings,
representing processions of rudely pictured human
figures, as shown in the accompanying cut. The
same author speaks of similar paintings, very likely
not the work of the original builders of Mitla, on the
walls of some of the other buildings.<a id="FNanchor_VII-60" href="#Footnote_VII-60" class="fnanchor">[VII-60]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Two mounds, or groups of mounds, stand west and
south of the other ruins at 5 and 7 of the plan. No.
5 was photographed by Charnay, and is described as
built of adobes, ascended by a stone stairway, and
bearing now a modern chapel. According to Castañeda's
drawing probably representing these pyramids,
the principal structure had four stories, or terraces,
and was about seventy-five feet high, measuring
at the base about one hundred and twenty feet on its
shortest sides from east to west. The stairway faces
westward towards the court formed by the smaller
mounds which have only two stories. Group No. 7
is represented by Castañeda as consisting like No. 5
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>
of a large mound and three small ones, of two and
one stories respectively, surrounding a court in whose
centre is a block, or altar, which Dupaix thinks may
conceal the entrance to a subterranean passage.
Mühlenpfordt represents the arrangement of the
mounds as on my plan, and thinks the smaller elevations
may have borne originally buildings like the
northern palaces. In one of these mounds, according
to the last-mentioned author, a tomb was found. Dupaix
also describes two tombs found under mounds,
the locality of which is not specified. One of these
tombs was in the form of a cross, with arms about
three by nine feet, six feet high, covered with a roof
of flat stones, and in its construction like the gallery
under palace No. 2, except that the small brick-shaped
blocks of which its sides are formed are not arranged
in grecques, but laid so as to present a plain surface.
The second tomb was of rectangular form, about four
by eight feet in dimensions. In one of them some
human remains, with fragments of fine blue stone
were discovered.<a id="FNanchor_VII-61" href="#Footnote_VII-61" class="fnanchor">[VII-61]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FORTIFIED HILL.</p>

<p>At a distance of a league and a half eastward of
the village, Dupaix described and Castañeda sketched
a small plain square stone building, divided into four
apartments, standing on the slope of a high rocky
hill. On the plate there is also shown the entrance
to a subterranean gallery not mentioned in Dupaix's
text.<a id="FNanchor_VII-62" href="#Footnote_VII-62" class="fnanchor">[VII-62]</a> Three fourths of a league westward from the
village is a hill some six hundred feet in height, with
precipitous sides naturally inaccessible save on one
side, toward Mitla. The summit platform, probably
leveled by artificial means, is enclosed by a wall of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
stone about six feet thick, eighteen feet high, and
over a mile in circumference, forming many angles, as
is shown in the annexed plan. On the eastern and accessible
side, the wall is double, the inner wall being
higher than the outer; and the entrances are not only
not opposite each other, but penetrate the walls obliquely.
Heaps of loose stones, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, were found at
various points in the enclosure, doubtless for use as
weapons in a hand-to-hand conflict. Outside of the
walls, moreover, large rocks, some three feet in diameter,
were carefully poised where they might be
easily started down the sides against the advancing
foe. Within the fortress, at several places, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>,
<i>g</i>, are slight remains of adobe buildings, probably
erected for the accommodation of the aboriginal garrison.
All we know of this fortress is derived from
the work of Dupaix and Castañeda.<a id="FNanchor_VII-63" href="#Footnote_VII-63" class="fnanchor">[VII-63]</a></p>

<p>Dupaix claims to have found the quarries which
furnished material for the Mitla structures, in a hill
three-fourths of a league eastward from the ruins,
called by the Zapotecs Aguilosoé, by the Spaniards
Mirador. The stone is described as of such a nature
that large blocks may be easily split off by means of
wedges and levers, and many such blocks were scattered
about the place; the removal of the stone to
the site of the palaces, here as in the case of many
other American ruins, must have been the chief difficulty
overcome by the builders. Stone wedges, together
with axes and chisels of hard copper, are said
to have been found at Mitla, but are not particularly
described.<a id="FNanchor_VII-64" href="#Footnote_VII-64" class="fnanchor">[VII-64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A head in terra cotta, wearing a peculiar helmet,
was sketched here by Castañeda, and is shown in the
cut. Another terra-cotta image represented a masked
human figure, squatting cross-legged with hands on
knees. A large semicircular cape reaches from the
neck to the ground, showing only the hands and feet
in front. The whole is very similar to some of the
figures at Zachila, already described, but the tube
which may be supposed to have held a torch originally,
projects above the head, and is an inch and a
half in diameter. The only specimen of stone images
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
or idols found in connection with the ruins, is shown
in the cut. It represents a seated figure, carved
from a hard red stone, and brilliantly polished. Its
height is about four inches. Tempsky tells us that
the children at Mitla offered for sale small idols of
clay and sandstone, which had been taken from the
inner palace walls.<a id="FNanchor_VII-65" href="#Footnote_VII-65" class="fnanchor">[VII-65]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">GENERAL REMARKS.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COMPARISONS.</p>

<p class="p2">The ruins of Mitla resemble Palenque only in the
long low narrow form of the buildings, since the low
supporting mounds can hardly be said to resemble
the lofty stone-faced pyramids of Chiapas. A stronger
likeness may be discovered when they are compared
with the structures of Yucatan; since in both
cases we find long narrow windowless buildings, raised
on low mounds, and enclosing a rectangular courtyard,
walls of rubble, and facings of hewn stone.
The contrasts are also strong, as seen in the mosaic
grecques, the absence of sculpture, and the flat roofs,
in some cases supported by columns; although in one
city on the east coast of Yucatan flat roofs of wooden
beams were found. Whether the mosaic work of
Mitla indicates in itself an earlier or later development
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>
of aboriginal art than the elaborately sculptured
façades of Uxmal, I am unable to decide; but the
flat roof supported by pillars would seem to indicate
a later architectural development than the overlapping
arch. The influence of the builders of Palenque
and the cities of Yucatan, was doubtless felt by the
builders of Mitla. How the influence was exerted it
is very difficult to determine; Viollet-le-Duc attributes
these northern structures to a branch of the
southern civilization separated from the parent stock
after the foundation of the Maya cities in Yucatan.
Most antiquarians have concluded that Mitla is less
ancient than the southern ruins, and the condition of
the remains, so far as it throws any light on the subject,
confirms the conclusion. This is the last ruin
that will be found in our progress northward, which
shows any marked analogy with the Maya monuments,
save in the almost universal use of supporting
mounds or pyramids, of various forms and dimensions.
It has already been shown that the Zapotec language
has no likeness whatever to the Aztec, or to the
Maya, and that so far as institutions are concerned,
this people might almost as properly be classed with
the Maya as with the Nahua nations. The Abbé
Brasseur in one part of his writings expresses the
opinion that Mitla was built by the Toltecs from
Cholula, who introduced their religion in Oajaca in
the ninth or tenth century. Mitla is also frequently
spoken of as a connecting link between the Central
American and Mexican remains; this, however, is
merely a part of the old favorite theory of one civilized
people originating in the far north, moving gradually
southward, and leaving at each stopping-place
traces of their constantly improving and developing
culture. There seems to have been no tradition
among the natives at the Conquest, indicating that
Mitla was built by a people preceding the Zapotecs.
On the contrary, Burgoa and other early Oajacan
chroniclers mention the place frequently as a Zapotec
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
holy place, devoted to the burial of kings, the residence
of a certain order of the priesthood, who lived
here to make expiatory sacrifices for the dead, and a
place of royal mourning, whither the king retired on
the death of a relative. Subterranean caverns were
used for the celebration of religious rites before the
upper temples were built. Charnay fancies that the
palaces were built by a people that afterwards migrated
southward. He noticed that the walls in
sheltered places were covered with very rude paintings&mdash;a
sample of which has been given&mdash;and suggests
that these were executed by occupants who
succeeded the original builders. It will be apparent
to the reader that the ruins at Mitla bear no resemblance
whatever to other Oajacan monuments, such
as those at Guiengola, Monte Alban, and Quiotepec;
and that they are either the work of a different nation,
or what is much more probable, for a different
purpose. I am inclined to believe that Mitla was
built by the Zapotecs at a very early period of their
civilization, at a time when the builders were strongly
influenced by the Maya priesthood, if they were not
themselves a branch of the Maya people.<a id="FNanchor_VII-66" href="#Footnote_VII-66" class="fnanchor">[VII-66]</a></p>

<p>The mosaic work undoubtedly bears a strong resemblance
to the ornamentation observed on Grecian
vases and other old-world relics; but this analogy is
far from indicating any communication between the
artists or their ancestors, for, as Humboldt says, "in
all zones men have been pleased with a rhythmic repetition
of the same forms, a repetition which constitutes
the leading characteristic of what we vaguely
call grecques, meandres, and Arabesques."<a id="FNanchor_VII-67" href="#Footnote_VII-67" class="fnanchor">[VII-67]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span></p>

<p>In the northern part of Oajaca, towards the boundary
line of Puebla, remains have been found in several
localities. Those near Quiotepec are extensive
and important, but are only known by the description
of one explorer, Juan N. Lovato, who visited the
ruins as a commissioner from the government in January,
1844.<a id="FNanchor_VII-68" href="#Footnote_VII-68" class="fnanchor">[VII-68]</a> Lovato's account contains many details,
but the drawings which originally accompanied it
were, with two exceptions, not published, and from
the text only a general idea can be formed respecting
the nature of the ruins. The following are such
items of information as I have been able to extract
from the report in question.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF QUIOTEPEC.</p>

<p>A hill about a mile long and a quarter of a mile
wide at its base, and over a thousand feet high,
known as the Cerro de las Juntas, stands at the
junction of the rivers Quiotepec and Salado. At the
eastern end, where the streams meet, the ascent is
precipitous and inaccessible, but the other sides and
the summit are covered with ruins. The slopes are
formed into level platforms with perpendicular terrace
walls of stone, of height and thickness varying according
to the nature of the ground. In ascending
the western slope, thirty-five of these terrace walls
were encountered; on the southern slope there were
fifty-seven, and on the northern eighty-eight, counting
only those that were still standing. One of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
walls at the summit is about three hundred and
twenty feet long, sixty feet high, and five and a
half feet thick.</p>

<p>Scattered over the hill on the terrace platforms,
the foundations of small buildings, supposed to have
been dwellings, were found in at least a hundred and
thirty places. In connection with these buildings
some tombs were found underground, box-shaped
with walls of stone, containing human remains and
some fragments of pottery. Tumuli in great numbers
are found in all directions, probably burial
mounds, although nothing but a few stone beads has
been found in them. Other mounds were apparently
designed for the support of buildings. At different
points towards the summit of the hill are three tanks,
or reservoirs, one of which is sixty feet long, twenty-four
feet wide, and six feet deep, with traces of steps
leading down into it. In the walls traces of beams
are seen, supposed by the explorer to have supported
the scaffolding used in their construction.</p>

<p class="caption">Temple Pyramid&mdash;Cerro de las Juntas.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the terrace walls, foundations of dwellings,
and the remains that have been mentioned, there are
also many ruins of statelier edifices, presumably palaces
and temples. Of these, the only ones described
are situated at the summit on a small level plateau, of
a hundred and twenty-two by two hundred and forty-eight
feet. These consist of what are spoken of as a
palace and a temple, facing each other, a hundred and
sixty-six feet apart. Between the two are the bases
of what was formerly a line of circular pillars, leading
from one edifice to the other. The bases, or pedestals,
are fourteen inches in diameter, five inches
high, and about fourteen feet apart. The Temple
faces north-east, and its front is shown in the accompanying
cut. This is a form of the pyramidal structure
very different from any that has been met before.
Its dimensions on the ground are fifty by fifty-five
feet. The Palace is described as thirty-nine feet
high in front and thirty-three feet in the rear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
has a stairway of twenty steps about twenty-eight
feet wide, leading up to the summit on the front.
Judging by the plate, this so-called palace is a solid
elevation with perpendicular sides, ornamented with
three plain cornices, one end of which is occupied
throughout nearly its whole width by the stairway
mentioned. The material of the two structures is
the stone of the hill itself cut in thin regular blocks,
laid in what is described as mud, and covered, as
is shown by traces still left in a few parts, with a
coating of plaster. Both the structures, according to
the plates, have a rather modern appearance, and differ
widely from any other American monuments, but
there seems to be no reason to doubt the reliability
of Sr Lovato's account, considering its official nature,
and I cannot suppose that the Spaniards ever erected
such edifices. The foundations and arches of three
small apartments are vaguely spoken of as having
been discovered by excavation in connection with the
Palace, but whether they were on its summit or in
the interior of the apparently solid mass, does not
clearly appear, although Müller states that the latter
was the case. On the summit of the Palace a copal-tree,
one foot in diameter, was found. Five sculptured
slabs were sketched by Müller at Quiotepec,
but he does not state in what part of the ruins they
were found. Each slab has a human figure in profile,
surrounded by a variety of inexplicable attributes.
The foreheads seem to be flattened, and four of the
five have an immense curved tongue, possibly the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span>
well-known Aztec symbol of speech, protruding from
the mouth. Somewhere in this vicinity, on the perpendicular
banks of rock that form the channel of the
Rio Tecomava, painted figures of a sun, moon, and
hand, are reported, at a great height from the
water.<a id="FNanchor_VII-69" href="#Footnote_VII-69" class="fnanchor">[VII-69]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TUXTEPEC AND HUAHUAPAN.</p>

<p>Near the town of Tuxtepec, some fifty miles eastward
from Quiotepec, near the Vera Cruz boundary,
there is said to be an artificial mound eighty-three
feet high, known as the Castillo de Montezuma. A
passage leads toward the centre, but nothing further
is known of it, except that some stone idols are mentioned
by another writer as having been dug from a
mound in a town of the same name.<a id="FNanchor_VII-70" href="#Footnote_VII-70" class="fnanchor">[VII-70]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Sculptured Block from Huahuapan.</p>
</div>

<p>At Huahuapan, about fifty miles westward of
Quiotepec, Dupaix found the sculptured block shown
in the cut. It is four and a half feet long, and a foot
and a half high; the material is a hard blue stone,
and the sculpture in low relief seems to represent a
kind of coat of arms, from which projects a hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
grasping an object, a part of which bears a strong
resemblance to the Aztec symbol of water. This
relic was found in a hill called Tallesto, about a
league east of the town.<a id="FNanchor_VII-71" href="#Footnote_VII-71" class="fnanchor">[VII-71]</a></p>

<p>In another hill, called Sombrerito, only half a
league from the town, a laborer in 1831 plowed up
an ancient grave, said to have contained human
bones, fine pottery, with gold beads and rings. All
the relics were buried again by the finder, except
four of the rings, which came into the possession of
the Bishop of Puebla, and two of which are shown
in the cut. With some doubts respecting the authenticity
of these relics I give the cuts for what
they are worth. There are accounts and drawings of
several rudely carved stone images from the same
region.<a id="FNanchor_VII-72" href="#Footnote_VII-72" class="fnanchor">[VII-72]</a></p>

<p>At Yanguitlan, ten or fifteen miles south-east of
Huahuapan, several relics were found, including a human
head of natural size carved from red stone; two
idols of green jasper, slightly carved in human likeness;
three cutting implements of hard stone; and the two
objects shown in the cuts on the opposite page. The
first is a spear-head of gray flint, and the second a
very curious relic of unknown use, and whose material
and dimensions the finder has neglected to mention.
It is of a red color, and is very beautifully
wrought in two pieces, one serving as a cover for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
other, apparently intended to be joined by a cord as
represented in the cut. Among the uses suggested
are those of a censer and a lantern.<a id="FNanchor_VII-73" href="#Footnote_VII-73" class="fnanchor">[VII-73]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ANTIQUITIES OF GUERRERO.</p>

<p class="p2">Respecting the relics of the state of Guerrero, my
only information is derived from a statistical work
by Sr Celso Muñoz, contained in the report of Gov.
Francisco O. Arce to the legislature of the state in
1872. This author mentions such relics in the district
of Hidalgo, north of the Rio Zacatula towards
the Mexican boundary, as follows: 1st. "The <i>momoxtles</i>,
or tombs of the ancient Indians, which are
found in almost all the towns, although they are constantly
disappearing, and abound especially in the
municipality of Cocula." 2d. "Traces of ancient settlements
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
of the aborigines, who either became extinct
or migrated to other localities: such are seen on the
hill of Huizteco, in the municipality of Tasco, in that
of Tetipac el Viejo and of Coatlan el Viejo, of Tetipac,
of Coculatepil, of Piedra Grande or San Gaspar,
region of Iglesia Vieja, Cocula, and many others."
3d. At Tepecoacuilco "there are traces very clearly
defined of many foundations of houses; and in excavations
that have been made there have been found
many idols and flint weapons, especially lances, very
well preserved, and other curious relics of Aztec
times." 4th. At Chontalcuatlan, there are traces of
the ancient town on a hill called Coatlan el Viejo,
where there is also said to be a block of porphyry one
or two mètres in diameter, on the surface of which is
sculptured a coiled serpent.<a id="FNanchor_VII-74" href="#Footnote_VII-74" class="fnanchor">[VII-74]</a></p>

<p>Passing now to the eastern or gulf coast, I shall
devote the present chapter to the antiquities of Vera
Cruz, the ancient home of the Totonacs in the north,
and the Xicalancas and Nonohualcos in the south.
Vera Cruz, with an average width of seventy miles,
extends from the Laguna de Santa Ana, the western
boundary of Tabasco, to the mouth of the River Pánuco,
a distance of about five hundred miles. Its
territory is about equally divided lengthwise between
the low malarious tierra caliente on the immediate
gulf shore, and the eastern slope of the lofty sierra
that bounds the Mexican plateau. Two or three
much-traveled routes lead inland from the port of
Vera Cruz towards the city of Mexico, and travelers
make haste to cross this plague-belt, the lurking-place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
of the deadly vomito, turning neither to the
right nor left to investigate the past or present. A
railroad now completed renders the transit still more
direct and rapid than before. Away from these
routes the territory of this state is less known than
almost any other portion of the Mexican Republic,
although a portion of the southern Goatzacoalco
region has been pretty thoroughly explored by surveyors
of the Tehuantepec interoceanic routes, and
by an unfortunate French colonization company that
settled here early in the present century. The
mountain slopes and plateaux twenty-five or thirty
miles inland are, however, fertile and not unhealthy,
having been crowded in ancient times with a dense
aboriginal population, traces of whose former presence
are found in every direction. Most of our information
respecting the antiquities of this state is
derived from the reports of Mexican explorers, only
one or two of whom have in most cases visited each
of the many groups of ruins. These explorers have
as a rule fallen into a very natural, perhaps, but at
the same time very unfortunate error in their descriptions;
for after having displayed great energy and
skill in the discovery and examination of a ruin,
doubtless forming a clear idea of all its details, they
usually compress these details into the space of a few
paragraphs or a few pages, and devote the larger part
of their reports to essays on the Toltec, Chichimec,
or Olmec history&mdash;subjects on which they can throw
no light. They neglect a topic of the deepest interest,
concerning which their authority would be of
the very greatest weight, for another respecting which
their conclusions are for the most part valueless.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RELICS AT SACRIFICIOS ISLAND.</p>

<p class="p2">The ruins of an aboriginal city are mentioned at
Caxapa, between the volcano of Tuxtla and the coast
in the southern part of the state.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-1" href="#Footnote_VIII-1" class="fnanchor">[VIII-1]</a> In the vicinity of
Tuxtla, at the south-western base of the volcano, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
colossal granite head, six feet high, was found by a
laborer in 1862, while making a clearing for a milpa.
The head was photographed, and a copy of the plate
published by the Mexican Geographical Society, together
with an accompanying text prepared by J. M.
Melgar. A copy of the plate is given in the cut.
The most noticeable peculiarity in this head is the
negro cast of the features, and Señor Melgar devotes
his article to the negro race, which as he supposes
lived in America before the coming of the Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-2" href="#Footnote_VIII-2" class="fnanchor">[VIII-2]</a></p>

<p>On the island of Sacrificios, in the harbor of Vera
Cruz, one author<a id="FNanchor_VIII-3" href="#Footnote_VIII-3" class="fnanchor">[VIII-3]</a> states that remains of the ancient
temple are visible. This is probably an error, but
numerous small relics have been dug up on the
island. Many of the relics were articles of pottery,
one of which of very peculiar form is shown in the cut
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
from Waldeck. This, like most of the other articles
found here, is preserved in the Museum of
Mexico, and was sketched by Mayer and by Waldeck.
Mr Tylor pronounces it not the work of the
natives before the Conquest, in fact a fraud, "one of
the worst cases I ever noticed." There is no doubt
of the accuracy of the drawing, and Sr Gondra assured
Col. Mayer, as the latter informs me, that the
relic is an authentic one.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-4" href="#Footnote_VIII-4" class="fnanchor">[VIII-4]</a> Workmen engaged in laying
the foundations of the modern fort found, at a
depth of six feet, vases of hard material, which in
the opinion of M. Baradère resembled vases that
have been brought from Japan.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-5" href="#Footnote_VIII-5" class="fnanchor">[VIII-5]</a> Col. Mayer gives
cuts of thirteen relics dug from a subterranean chamber
or grave in 1828. Two of these were of white
marble or alabaster, and one of them is shown in
the cut. M. Dumanoir made an excavation also in
1841, finding a sepulchre containing well-preserved
human skeletons, earthen vases painted and etched,
idols, images, bracelets, teeth of dogs and wild beasts,
and marble, or alabaster, urns. Plates of many of
the relics have been published.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-6" href="#Footnote_VIII-6" class="fnanchor">[VIII-6]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">REMAINS ON THE EASTERN SLOPE.</p>

<p>From the city of Vera Cruz two main routes of
travel lead inland toward the city of Mexico. The
first extends north-westward via Jalapa, and the second
south-westward via Orizava. After crossing the
first lofty mountain barrier which divides the coast
from the interior plateaux, the roads approach each
other and meet near Puebla. On the eastern slope,
the roads with the mountain range, which at this
point extends nearly north and south, form a triangle
with equal sides of about eighty miles, at the
angles of which are the cities of Vera Cruz, Jalapa,
and Orizava, or more accurately points ten or fifteen
miles above the two latter. This comparatively small
triangular area, round which so many travelers have
passed in their journey to Anáhuac, is literally covered
with traces of its aboriginal population, in the
shape of pottery, implements, foundation stones of
dwellings, fortifications, pyramids, and graves. I
quote the following from an article on the antiquities
of Vera Cruz, written in 1869, for the Mexican Geographical
Society, by Carlos Sartorius:</p>

<p>"On the eastern slope of the lofty volcanic range,
from the Peak of Orizava to the Cofre de Perote, at
an average elevation of two to five thousand feet
above the level of the gulf, there exist innumerable
traces of a very numerous indigenous population before
the Conquest. History tells us nothing respecting
this part of the country, distinguished for its
abundant supply of water, its fertility, and its delightful
and healthy climate." "For an extent of
fifteen to twenty leagues, from east to west, there
was not a span of earth that was not cultivated, as is
proved by numberless remains.... The whole country
is formed into terraces by stone walls, which follow all
the variations of the surface with the evident object
of preventing the washing away of the soil. Sometimes
the terraces are ten or twelve yards wide, at
others hardly one yard. The small ravines called
<i>rayas</i> served for innumerable water-tanks, built of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>
rocks and clay, or of stone and mortar, these dams
being also covered with a coating of hard cement.
It is evident that a numerous population took advantage
of every inch of land for cultivation, using
the water gathered in the tanks during the rainy
season for irrigation, possibly effected by hand by
means of earthern vessels. In the more sterile portions
of the land, on the top of hills which have no
soil are seen the foundations of dwellings, all of
stone without mortar, arranged in streets or in
groups. They always form an oblong rectangle and
face the cardinal points. They are found in clearing
heavy forests as well as on open tracts, and the fact
that oaks a mètre in diameter are found within the
enclosure of the walls, proves that many centuries
have passed since the population disappeared. In
many parts are found groups of pyramids, of various
sizes and degrees of preservation. The largest, of
stone, are fifty feet and over in height, while the
smallest are not over ten or twelve. The last seem
to be tombs; at least several that we opened contained
skeletons in a very decomposed state, with
earthen utensils like those now made by the natives,
arrow-heads of obsidian and bird-bone, doubtless the
supplies given to the dead for their journey." One
contained an elegant burial urn, bearing ornamental
figures in relief, containing ashes and fragments of
human bones, and covered first with small pebbles,
and then with stone flags. "The region which we
subjected to our investigation comprehends the slope
of the sierra to the coast between Orizava and Jalapa.
At an elevation of four or five thousand feet there
are many springs, which at a short distance form
ravines in a soil composed of conglomerates or, further
south, of lime. In their course the ravines
unite and form points sometimes with vertical walls
of considerable height. As the water-courses do not
follow a straight line, but wind about, the erosion of
the current above the meeting of the ravines destroys
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
a great portion of the dividing ridge, so that above
there remains only a narrow pass, the ridge afterwards
assuming greater width until the end is
reached. This play of nature occurs in the region of
which we are speaking, at many points and with
great uniformity, almost always at the same level of
two thousand to twenty-five hundred feet. The
natives selected these points, strong by nature, fortifying
them by art so ingeniously as to leave no doubt
as to their progress in military art.... Some of them
are almost inaccessible, and can be reached only by
means of ladders and ropes. They all have this
peculiarity in common, that, besides serving for defense,
they enclose a number of edifices destined for
worship,&mdash;teocallis and traces of very large structures,
such as residences, quarters, or perhaps palaces of the
priests and rulers. In some of them there are
springs and remains of large artificial tanks; in
others, aqueducts of stone and mortar, to bring water
from distant springs." Sr Sartorius then proceeds to
the description of particular ruins, of which more
hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-7" href="#Footnote_VIII-7" class="fnanchor">[VIII-7]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRACES OF ABORIGINAL POPULATION.</p>

<p>Mr Hugo Finck, a resident for twenty-eight years
in the region under consideration, in which he traveled
extensively to collect botanical specimens, contributed
the following general remarks to the Smithsonian
Report for 1870: "There is hardly a foot of
ground in the whole state of Vera Cruz [the author
refers particularly to the region about Córdova, Huatusco,
and Mirador] in which, by excavation, either a
broken obsidian knife, or a broken piece of pottery is
not found. The whole country is intersected with
parallel lines of stones, which were intended during
the heavy showers of the rainy season to keep the
earth from washing away. The number of those
lines of stones shows clearly that even the poorest
land, which nobody in our days would cultivate, was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>
put under requisition by them.... In this part of the
country no trace of iron or copper tools has ever come
under my notice. Their implements of husbandry
and war were of hard stone, but generally of obsidian
and of wood. The small mounds of stones near their
habitations have the form of a parallelogram, and are
not over twenty-seven inches high. Their length is
from five to twelve yards, their width from two to
four. On searching into them nothing is found. A
second class of mounds is round, in the form of a cone,
always standing singly. They are built of loose
stones and earth, and of various sizes; some as high
as five yards, with a diameter of from five to twenty
yards. Excavation made in them brought to light a
large pot of burned clay filled with ashes, but in general
nothing is found. The third class of mounds,
also built of loose stones and earth, have the form of
a parallelogram, whose smaller sides look east and
west, and are from five to six yards high, terminating
at the top in a level space of from three to five yards
in width, the base being from eight to twelve yards.
They are found from fifteen to two hundred yards
long. Sometimes several are united, forming a hollow
square, which must have been used as a fortress.
Others again have their outer surface made of masonry,
but still the inside is filled up with loose stones
and earth. Near river-beds, where stones are very
abundant, these tumuli are largest. Principally in
this latter class, idols, implements of husbandry and
war are discovered, sometimes lying quite loose, and
at others imbedded in hollow square boxes made of
masonry. The last-described mounds form the transition
to those constructions which are altogether built
of solid masonry.... One peculiarity of the last-mentioned
ruins is, that they are all constructed at the
junction of two ravines, and used as fortresses, on
account of their impregnability. Most of the larger
barrancas have precipitous sides from three hundred
to one thousand feet deep, which guarded the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>
on their flank, so that nothing more was required
than to build a wall, leaving a small entrance
in the middle, as a passage, which could be barricaded
in time of war.... Such constructions can be seen to
this day in tolerable good condition. The interior of
these fortified inclosures is in general large, sometimes
holding from four to five square miles, and could be
put under cultivation in case of a siege. The wall is
in general from four to five yards high, and has on
the inside terraces with steps to lead to the top. At
other places there is a series of semicircular walls, the
front one lower than the following, and a passage between
each to permit one person at a time to pass
from one to the other. The innermost wall is sometimes
perforated with loopholes through which arrows
could be thrown. Quite a number of ruins are found
inside the fortification, as mounds, altars, good level
roads with a foundation of mortar. Most of these
monuments have good preserved steps leading to the
top. In some very small pots of burning clay are
found filled with ashes."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-8" href="#Footnote_VIII-8" class="fnanchor">[VIII-8]</a></p>

<p>The preceding quotations are sufficient to give a
clear idea of the ruins in their general features, and
leave only such particular remains as have been made
known through the labors of different explorers to be
described. Some ten or twelve of the peculiar fortified
places alluded to above have been more or less
fully described, but as there is no even tolerably accurate
topographical map of this region, it is utterly
impossible to locate them. Each stream, ravine,
bluff, hill, and mountain of all the labyrinth, has its
local name; indeed, some of them seem to have two
or three, but most of them have no place on the
maps. It is consequently quite possible that the
same ruins have been described under more than one
name. I shall present each group as it is described
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>
by the explorer, giving when possible the distance
and bearing from some point laid down on the map
which accompanies this volume.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">AMATLAN AND ORIZAVA.</p>

<p class="p2">Before treating of these ruins, however, I shall
mention some miscellaneous relics, from the region
under consideration, found at well-known towns, or
in their vicinity. Colonel Albert S. Evans dug two
terra-cotta images from a grave at Medellin, about
eight miles south-west of Vera Cruz, in 1869. They
seem to represent a male and female, and are now in
the collection of Mr C. D. Voy, of Oakland, California.
Near the same town, on the Rio Jamapa,
are to be seen, Brasseur tells us, the ruins of one of
the two ancient cities called Xicalanco; and also that
the traces of an ancient city may yet be seen under
the water between the city of Vera Cruz and the
fort of San Juan de Ulloa.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-9" href="#Footnote_VIII-9" class="fnanchor">[VIII-9]</a> About forty-five miles
south-east of Córdova, between that town and the
bridge over the Rio Blanco, Dupaix found a hard
stone of dark blue color, artificially worked into an
irregular spherical form, about six feet in diameter,
and so carefully balanced that it could be made to
vibrate by a slight touch. A number of small shallow
holes were formed on the surface. A similar
stone is placed two leagues to the eastward, and they
are supposed by Dupaix to have served as boundary
marks. Teololinga is the name by which the natives
call them.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-10" href="#Footnote_VIII-10" class="fnanchor">[VIII-10]</a> Also in the neighborhood of Córdova, at
Amatlan de los Reyes, certain traces of a temple are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>
vaguely mentioned by the same traveler; and on a
wooded hillside near by is a cave, in which have been
found fragments of carved stone and pottery, including
a squatting trunk and legs, and a head carved
from the same kind of stone that constitutes the walls
of the cave. The latter relic is shown in the cut.
The form of the head seems to have nothing in common
with the ordinary aboriginal type.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-11" href="#Footnote_VIII-11" class="fnanchor">[VIII-11]</a></p>

<p>At Orizava two relics were seen, one of them a triangular
stone five feet thick and ninety feet in circumference,
used in modern times as the floor of a native's
cabin. On one of the triangular surfaces was incised
in rude outline a colossal human figure twenty-seven
feet high, standing with legs spread apart and arms
outstretched. A girdle appears at the waist, plumes
decorate the head, and the mouth is wide open. On
one side a fish stands on its tail; on the other is a rabbit
with ten small circles, very likely expressing some
date after the Aztec manner,&mdash;ten tochtli. Some
carvings not described were noticed on the edges also.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>
The other relic was a kind of yoke carved from green
jasper and supposed to have been used in connection with
the Aztec sacrifices. It is shown in the cut according
to Castañeda's drawing. The original yoke was carried
by Dupaix to Mexico and deposited in one of the
antiquarian collections there, where it was afterwards
sketched by Mayer and Gondra.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-12" href="#Footnote_VIII-12" class="fnanchor">[VIII-12]</a> Near Jalapa, Rivera
states that a serpent fifteen feet long and nine
feet broad, may be seen carved in the rock.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-13" href="#Footnote_VIII-13" class="fnanchor">[VIII-13]</a> Half
a day's journey from Vera Cruz towards Mexico,
at a point which he calls Rinconado, Robert Tomson
saw "a great pinacle made of lime and stone, fast

their sacrifices vnto their gods."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-14" href="#Footnote_VIII-14" class="fnanchor">[VIII-14]</a> About the location
of Cempoala, a famous city in the time of the Conquest,
there has been much discussion. Lorenzana
says that the place "still retains the same name; it is
situated four leagues from Vera Cruz, and the extent
of its ruins indicates its former greatness." Rivera
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
tells us, however, that "to-day not even the ruins of
this capital of the Totonac power remain," although
some human bones have been dug up about its site.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-15" href="#Footnote_VIII-15" class="fnanchor">[VIII-15]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS AT PUENTE NACIONAL.</p>

<p>Passing now to the labyrinth of ruins within the
triangular area extending from the peaks of Orizava
and Perote to the coast, I begin with those in the
vicinity of the Puente Nacional, where the road from
Vera Cruz to Jalapa crosses the Rio de la Antigua.
These remains are located on the summit of a forest-covered
hill over a hundred feet high, on the bank of
the river some two leagues from the bridge. They
were discovered in 1819 or 1820 by a priest named
Cabeza de Vaca, and in November, 1843, J. M. Esteva,
to whom the priest related his discovery, made
an exploration, and as a result published a description
with two plates in the <i>Museo Mexicano</i>. On the uneven
surface of the hill-top stands a pyramid of very
peculiar form, shown in the cut, which is an ichnographic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>
plan of the structure. It is built of stone
and mortar, the former probably in hewn blocks,
although the text is not clear on this point. The
height varies from thirty-three to forty-two feet, according
to the inequalities of the ground. The circumference
is not far from three hundred English feet,
while the summit platform measures about fifty-five
by forty-four feet. On all sides except the eastern
the slope is divided into six stories, or steps, about
one foot wide and seven feet high at the base but
diminishing towards the top, making the ascent much
steeper than that of most aboriginal pyramids that
we have met hitherto. The eastern side is all taken
up by a stairway about sixty-three feet wide, consisting
of thirty-four steps. This stairway, as is more
clearly shown in Esteva's view of this side than in
my cut, is arranged in the form of a cross.</p>

<p>On the western base is the entrance to a gallery
which penetrates the body of the pyramid; it was
obstructed by fallen stones, but Esteva succeeded in
exploring the passage far enough to convince himself
that the interior was divided into several apartments.
At some distance from the pyramid were noticed the
foundations of a wall.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-16" href="#Footnote_VIII-16" class="fnanchor">[VIII-16]</a></p>

<p>Mr Lyon mentions the existence of ruins&mdash;which
he did not visit&mdash;in this vicinity on the edge of a
plateau, at the north side of the valley, about a mile
and a half to the right of the road, and only a short
distance from Paso de Ovejas. "All that remains
are the traces of streets and inclosures, and an assemblage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
of pyramidical elevations of earth and stones
of various sizes, some of them forty feet in height."
Sr Sartorius reports very extensive ruins on the right
bank of the Antigua, some leagues west of Consoquitla,
near Tuzamapa, from the material of which
the 'puente nacional' was constructed. An old native
also reported that a spiral stairway formerly led
down to the bottom of the barranca. Whether the
two groups of ruins last mentioned are identical with
that described by Esteva, it is impossible to determine;
quite likely they are distinct remains.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-17" href="#Footnote_VIII-17" class="fnanchor">[VIII-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">FORTIFICATIONS OF CENTLA.</p>

<p class="p2">Some twenty-five or thirty miles northward from
Córdova, in the vicinity of Huatusco, and stretching
northward from that town, is a line of fortified places,
nearly every junction of two ravines bearing more or
less extensive remains. One of the most extensive
of these works is that known as Centla, a few leagues
north-east of Huatusco. The ruins are said to have
been discovered by rancheros in 1821. Ignacio Iberri
saw them in 1826, but published no description.
An explorer whose name is not given visited the locality
in 1832, and furnished information from which
Sr Gondra published an account, illustrated with
plates, in 1837. Sr Sartorius made an exploration
of Centla in 1833, but his description, also accompanied
with plates, was not published until 1869.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-18" href="#Footnote_VIII-18" class="fnanchor">[VIII-18]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FORTRESS OF CENTLA.</p>

<p>Two ravines, running from east to west, with precipitous
sides from three hundred to a thousand feet
high, approach so near to each other as to leave only
space for a passage about three feet wide, and this
narrow pass is made still stronger by protecting walls
not particularly described. The barrancas then diverge
and again converge, forming an oval table of
about four hundred acres, across which, from east to
west is excavated a ditch, or protected road, about
seventeen feet wide and from eight to eleven feet
deep, leading to the second narrow pass, where the
ravines again approach each other.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-19" href="#Footnote_VIII-19" class="fnanchor">[VIII-19]</a></p>

<p>This second pass is about twenty-eight feet wide
from the brink of the northern to that of the southern
precipice.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-20" href="#Footnote_VIII-20" class="fnanchor">[VIII-20]</a> This pass is fortified by defensive
works of the strongest character, the plan of which is
shown in the cut on the following page. The only
entrance is through the narrow passage only three
feet wide, shown by the arrows, beginning at the
southern brink, passing between two stone pyramids,
A, and E, D, C, and then along the northern brink
to the plateau beyond, the issue into the latter being
guarded additionally by three smaller pyramids. The
chief pyramid on the right of the entrance is built of
stone and mortar in three stories, or terraces, C, D
and E, respecting the arrangement of which the plan<a id="FNanchor_VIII-21" href="#Footnote_VIII-21" class="fnanchor">[VIII-21]</a>
is not altogether satisfactory; but each story is reached
by a stairway on the east, and on the summit are
parapets pierced with loopholes for the discharge of
weapons. This structure is also flanked on the south,
where the descent for a short distance is less precipitous
than elsewhere, by a terraced wall at B. The
left hand fortification, A, is described by Gondra as a
simple wall, but according to Sartorius and the plan
it is also a pyramid, with stairway on the east and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
parapets on the summit. It has apparently only one
story, and is lower than its companion, but its front
has an additional protection in the form of a ditch
eleven feet wide and five and a half feet deep, excavated
in the solid rock, the position of which is shown
by the dotted line <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-22" href="#Footnote_VIII-22" class="fnanchor">[VIII-22]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Beyond the narrow fortified pass that has been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>
described, the southern ravine again diverges and
forms a semicircle before joining that on the north,
forming thus a peninsular plateau a mile and a half
long, and somewhat less than three quarters of a mile
wide, covered with soil of great fertility, and divided
in two parts by the waters of a spring, whose waters
flow through the centre. Since its discovery this fertile
table has been settled and cultivated by modern
farmers, some twenty families of whom&mdash;whether
native or Spanish is not stated&mdash;were living here in
1832. The whole surface was covered with traces of
its former inhabitants, but most of the monuments in
the cultivated portions have been destroyed by the
settlers, who used the stones for buildings and fences.
In other parts, covered with a forest at the time of
exploration, extensive remains were found in good
preservation, besides the fortresses at the entrance.
Pyramids of different dimensions, standing singly and
in groups, together with foundations of houses and
sculptured fragments, were scattered in every direction
enveloped in the forest growth.</p>

<img src="images/i442.jpg" width="550" height="164" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Type of Pyramids at Centla.</p>
</div>

<p>The pyramids are all built of rough stones, clay,
and earth, faced on the outside with hewn blocks
from eighteen inches to two feet long, laid in mortar.
The stone seems to have been brought from the bottom
of the ravines, and it is said that no lime is procurable
within a distance of fifteen or twenty miles.
Sartorius gives a plate representing one of the pyramids,
which he states to be a type of all those at
Centla, and indeed of all in this region, and which is
copied in the cut. The stairways are generally on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>
the west, and the niches at the sides are represented
as having arched tops and as occupied by idols.
Some of the smaller mounds have been found to contain
human skeletons lying north and south, and from
one of them a farmer claimed to have dug a number
of green stone beads. Sartorius claims to have found
in connection with one of the pyramids an altar having
a concavity on the top, and a canal leading to a
receptacle at the foot of the mound; he also mentions
a very elegant vase, six by four inches, found under
a stone flag, near the altar. Gondra speaks of a large
square or court, level and covered with a coat of hard
polished cement; he also claims that six columns of
stone and mortar were seen, twelve feet high, standing
at the bottom of a ravine.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS AT HUATUSCO.</p>

<p>Dupaix in his first exploring tour visited Huatusco,
and states that at a distance of half a league down
the river from the modern town was found a group of
ruins known as the Pueblo Viejo. These ruins were
on the slope of a hill, and on the summit stood the
pyramid shown in the cut, known as El Castillo. The
height of this Castle is about sixty-six feet, and according
to Dupaix's text the base is two hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>
twenty-one feet square, but, according to Castañeda's
drawing, copied above, each side is not over seventy-five
feet.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-23" href="#Footnote_VIII-23" class="fnanchor">[VIII-23]</a> The foundation, or pyramid proper, is
built in three stories, being about thirty-seven feet
high. A broad stairway, with solid balustrade, leads
up the western front. On the summit platform stands
a building in three stories, with walls about eight feet
thick, which, at least on the exterior, are not perpendicular
but slope inward. The lower story has but
one doorway, that at the head of the stairway; it
forms a single hall, in the centre of which are three
pillars, which sustained the beams of the floor above,
pieces of the beams being yet visible. The two upper
stories seem to have had no doors or windows. Dupaix
says that on the summit was a platform three
feet thick, yet as the roof was fallen, he probably had
little or no authority for the statement. The interior
of the whole structure was a rubble of stone and mortar,
and the facing of hewn blocks regularly laid.
The whole exterior surface, at least of the superimposed
structure, was covered with a polished coating
of plaster, and a peculiar ornament is seen in each
side of the second story, in the form of a large panel,
containing regular rows of round stones imbedded in
the wall. El Castillo, if we may credit Dupaix's account
of it, must be regarded as a very important
monument of Nahua antiquity, by reason of the edifice,
in a tolerable state of preservation, found on the
summit of the pyramid. These upper structures with
interior apartments have in most instances entirely
disappeared. In connection with these ruins Dupaix
found a coiled serpent carved from hard stone; a fragment
of terra-cotta with decorations in relief; and a
fancifully modeled skull, the material of which is not
stated.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-24" href="#Footnote_VIII-24" class="fnanchor">[VIII-24]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FORTRESS OF TLACOTEPEC.</p>

<p>Sartorius mentions a 'castle,' with towers and teocallis,
situated on a frightful cliff between two barrancas,
three leagues from Huatusco, distinct from Centla,
and some leagues further southward.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-25" href="#Footnote_VIII-25" class="fnanchor">[VIII-25]</a> Clavigero says
that in his time the ancient fortress of Quauhtochco,
or Guatusco, was still standing, surrounded with lofty
walls of solid stone, which could only be entered by
means of many high and narrow steps.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-26" href="#Footnote_VIII-26" class="fnanchor">[VIII-26]</a> Sr Iberri
applies the name El Castillo to the ruins visited by
him in 1826, but it is evident from his slight description
that he refers to Centla.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-27" href="#Footnote_VIII-27" class="fnanchor">[VIII-27]</a> It is clear that at
least two and probably more groups of remains are
indicated by the different authorities cited.</p>

<p class="p2">The following are mentioned as the localities of
undescribed ruins, several of them belonging to what
seems to be a line of ancient fortifications extending
northward from the vicinity of Huatusco: Cotastla,
Matlaluca, Capulapa, Tlapala, Poxtla, Xicuintla, and
Chistla.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-28" href="#Footnote_VIII-28" class="fnanchor">[VIII-28]</a> The fortress of Tlacotepec is located four
leagues east of Jolutla, between the Rio de la Antigua
and Paso de Ovejas, six thousand varas west of
and a quarter of a league above the houses of the
hacienda of Mirador, separated by a deep ravine
from San Martin on the south&mdash;a location which
might possibly be clear enough with the aid of a
good map, or to a person perfectly familiar with the
topography of the country. The position of the
fortified plateau is similar to that of Centla, and a
ditch, generally fourteen feet deep and from sixteen
to eighteen feet wide, leads over the hills for
several leagues to the entrance of the plateau. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span>
ditch, however, seems only to be excavated in the
earth, and disappears in several places where the
solid rock is encountered.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-29" href="#Footnote_VIII-29" class="fnanchor">[VIII-29]</a> At the terminus, towards
the fortifications, the ditch widens into a rectangular
excavation, one hundred and eight by two
hundred and seventy-six feet, surrounded with an
embankment formed of the earth thrown out. The
defensive works which guard the passage between
the ravines, and the extensive ruins of temples and
dwellings on the plateau beyond, are described only
by Sartorius, and his text, plan, and sketch, all fail
to convey any clear notion respecting the arrangement
and details of these remains. The following,
however, are the principal features noted:&mdash;A wall
twenty-eight feet high across the entrance to the
plateau; two small towers in pyramidal form on the
narrow pass; a building called the castle, apparently
somewhat similar to the fortifications at Centla; a
line of pyramids, serving as a second line of defense;
a ditch excavated in the solid rock; another group of
pyramids protected by a semicircular wall; an excavation
apparently intended as a reservoir for water,
covering two thousand square yards, the bottom of
which is literally covered with fragments of pottery,
and on the banks of which are the foundations of
many dwellings; a number of temple pyramids, like
the type at Centla shown in a preceding cut, one of
them having the so-called blood-canal; an earthen
receptacle at the foot of the altar, filled with earth,
in which were found two human skulls; the foundations
of an edifice two hundred yards long, having
along its whole length "a corridor of cement with
hewn stone at its sides, forming one or two steps;" a
small pyramid formed from the living rock of the
cliff, at the very edge of the precipice where the ravines
meet; and finally, arrow-heads, lance-heads, and
knives of obsidian, which are found at every step,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>
and are even dug up from under the roots of large
trees.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-30" href="#Footnote_VIII-30" class="fnanchor">[VIII-30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">REMAINS ABOUT MIRADOR.</p>

<p>A few leagues eastward from Tlacotepec on the
same barranca, are two forts known as Palmillas, separated
by a deep ravine. One of them was used by
the Mexican forces under General Victoria in the war
of independence; the other has the remains of an
aqueduct which brought water from a point over a
league distant.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-31" href="#Footnote_VIII-31" class="fnanchor">[VIII-31]</a> At Zacuapan, near Mirador, and
five leagues from Huatusco, according to Heller, are
remains of the ordinary type, including terraced walls,
parapets with loopholes, a plaza with plastered pavement
in the centre of which stands a pyramid, a
cubical structure or altar on the very verge of the
precipice, and the usual scattered pottery and implements.
Six miles south of Mirador the same traveler
mentions some baths, on a rock near which is the inscription
shown in the cut.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-32" href="#Footnote_VIII-32" class="fnanchor">[VIII-32]</a> Also in the vicinity of
Mirador, at the junction of two tributaries of the
Santa María, is the fortress of Consoquitla, similar to
the others. A line of plastered pyramidal structures
is mentioned, in one of the smallest of which was a tomb
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>
three by six feet lying north and south and covered
with large stone flags. Within the tomb was a skeleton,
together with earthen boxes filled with arrow-heads
and bird-bones. Some large idols are also said
to have been found here, and on the summit platform
of some of the pyramids were the marks of upright
beams, which seem to have supported wooden buildings.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-33" href="#Footnote_VIII-33" class="fnanchor">[VIII-33]</a>
Calcahualco, 'ruined houses,' is also on one of
the tributaries of the Santa María. A parapeted
wall fifty-five feet long protects the entrance, and
could only be crossed by the aid of ropes or ladders.
The wall seems to stand in an excavation, so that its
top is about on a level with the original surface of the
plateau. Within the fortifications is a large pyramid
surrounded by smaller ones and by the foundations of
houses; and another excavation, a hundred yards long
and twenty-five in width, is vaguely mentioned as of
unknown use. A mile and a half further south-east
are some ruins in the bottom of a ravine. A wall
nine feet high rises from the water's edge, and on it
stand a row of round monolithic columns, which seem
to have supported a stone architrave.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-34" href="#Footnote_VIII-34" class="fnanchor">[VIII-34]</a> Mr Tylor noticed
some remains by the roadside, at the eastern foot
of Orizava, as he was traveling towards San Antonio
de Abajo.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-35" href="#Footnote_VIII-35" class="fnanchor">[VIII-35]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF MISANTLA.</p>

<p class="p2">Northward from the triangular area, the remains
of which I have described, ruins seem to be no less
abundant, and accounts of them no less unsatisfactory.
The remains known by the name of Misantla, from
a modern pueblo near by, are located some twenty-five
or thirty miles north-eastward of Jalapa, near the
headwaters of the Rio Bobos. They are sometimes
called Monte Real, from the name of one of the hills
in the vicinity. They were discovered accidentally
by men searching for lost goats, and visited by Mariano
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Jaimes in 1836; in October of the same year, I.
R. Gondra, from information furnished by the discoverers
and Jaimes, and from certain newspaper accounts,
wrote and published a very perplexing description,
illustrated with a plan and two views. In the
same or the following year J. I. Iberri made an official
exploration of Misantla, or Monte Real, and his report,
also illustrated with many plates, and rivaling
that of Gondra in its unsatisfactory nature, was published
in 1844. Not only are the two accounts individually
to a great extent unintelligible, but neither
they nor their accompanying illustrations seem to have
any well-defined resemblance to each other.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-36" href="#Footnote_VIII-36" class="fnanchor">[VIII-36]</a></p>

<p>The site of the ruins seems to be a ravine-bounded
plateau, somewhat similar to those already described,
the approach to which is guarded by a wall. This
wall extends not only across the pass, but down one
of the slopes, which is not so steep as to be naturally
inaccessible to an enemy. According to Iberri the
wall is a natural vein of porphyry, artificially cut
down in some parts, and built up by the addition of
blocks of stone in others, measuring three yards high
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">450</a></span>
and two in width. The same explorer, after passing
the wall and climbing with much difficulty to a point
about two hundred and fifty feet higher, found a
pyramid standing on a terraced hill, on the terraces
of which were various traces of houses and fortifications.
The pyramid was built of porphyry and basalt
in blocks of different sizes, laid in mortar, was thirty-three
feet square at the base and seventeen feet high,
and had a narrow stairway on one side at least. On
the summit platform were traces of apartments of
rough stones and mortar; also a canal nine inches
square, leading to the exterior. The first wall mentioned
by Gondra in the approach to the ruins, was
one of large stones in poor mortar, mostly fallen; it
seemed to form a part of walls that bounded a plaza
of nearly circular form, in the centre of which stood
the pyramid. This edifice was forty-seven by forty-one
feet at the base, twenty-eight feet high, and
was built in three stories; the lower story had a central
stairway on the front, the second had stairways
on the sides, while on the third story the steps were
in the rear. There are also some traces of a stairway
on the front of the second story. The whole surface
is covered with trees, one of which is described as
being about fourteen feet high, and over eight feet in
diameter. The only resemblance in the two views of
this pyramid, is the representation of a tree on the
summit in each; between the two plans there is not
the slightest likeness; and so far as Iberri's third
figure is concerned, it seems to resemble nothing in
heaven above, the earth beneath, or the waters under
the earth. Both authors agree on the existence
of many house-foundations of stone without
mortar, extending the whole length of the plateau.
According to Iberri these houses were eleven by
twenty-two feet, some of them divided in several
apartments, standing on the terraces of the hill, only
a foot and a half apart, along regular streets about
six feet wide. The walls are of hewn stone without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>
mortar, and none remained standing over three feet
high. Gondra represents the houses as extending in
three and four straight and parallel rows for over two
miles on the plateau, with a wall of masonry running
the whole length on the south. At various points on
the summit and slopes of the hill tombs are found,
containing seated skeletons and relics of obsidian and
pottery. One of these tombs, as represented by
Gondra, is shown in the cut, in which the arched
doorway has a very suspicious look.</p>

<img src="images/i451.jpg" width="116" height="117" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Tomb at Misantla.</p>
</div>

<p>The miscellaneous relics found in connection with
the ruins and in the tombs include pottery, metates,
slabs with sculptured grecques, hieroglyphics, and
human figures in relief, stone images of different
sizes up to eighteen inches, representing human
figures seated with elbows on the knees, and head
raised; and finally an obsidian tube, a foot in diameter
and eighteen inches long, very perfectly turned,
together with similar earthen tubes with interior
compartments. Such is all the information I am
able to glean from the published accounts and plates
respecting Misantla, in the vicinity of which town
other groups of ruins are very vaguely mentioned.</p>

<p>In the same range of mountains, in the district of
Jalancingo, walls of hewn stone, with well-preserved
subterranean structures containing household idols,
are mentioned as existing at Mescalteco; also some
remains at Pueblo Viejo and Jorse, those of the
latter including a remarkable stone statue of marble.
This reported relic is said to have represented a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>
naked woman clasping a bird in her arms. The
lower parts of the woman are missing, and the bird
much mutilated, but the prefect of Jalancingo says
in his report, "it would be easy to complete the

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF PAPANTLA.</p>

<p>About a hundred and fifty miles north-westward
from Vera Cruz, fifty miles in the same direction
from the ruins of Misantla, forty-five miles from the
coast, and four or five miles south-west from the
pueblo of Papantla, stands the pyramid shown in
the cut, known to the world by the name of the
pueblo, Papantla, but called by the Totonac natives
of the region, El Tajin, the 'thunderbolt.' It was
accidentally discovered in March, 1785, by one Diego
Ruiz, who was exploring this part of the county in
an official capacity, with a view to prevent the illegal
raising of tobacco; and from his report a description
and copper-plate engraving were prepared and published
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
in the <i>Gaceta de Mexico</i>.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-38" href="#Footnote_VIII-38" class="fnanchor">[VIII-38]</a> Humboldt described
but did not visit the pyramid. He states
that Dupaix and Castañeda explored and made drawings
of it, but neither description nor plates appear
in the work of these travelers.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-39" href="#Footnote_VIII-39" class="fnanchor">[VIII-39]</a> The German
artist Nebel visited Papantla about 1831, and made
a fine and doubtless perfectly accurate drawing, from
which the cut which I have given has been copied.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-40" href="#Footnote_VIII-40" class="fnanchor">[VIII-40]</a></p>

<p>The pyramid stands in a dense forest, apparently
not on a naturally or artificially fortified plateau like
the remains further south. Its base is square, measuring
a little over ninety feet on each side, and the
height is about fifty-four feet; the whole structure
was built in seven stories, the upper story being partially
in ruins.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-41" href="#Footnote_VIII-41" class="fnanchor">[VIII-41]</a> Except the upper story, which seems
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span>
to have contained interior compartments, the whole
structure was, so far as known, solid. The material
of which it was built is sandstone, in regularly cut
blocks laid in mortar&mdash;although Humboldt, perhaps
on the authority of Dupaix, says the material is porphyry
in immense blocks covered with hieroglyphic
sculpture&mdash;the whole covered on the exterior surface
with a hard cement three inches thick, which also
bears traces of having been painted. According to
the account in the <i>Gaceta</i>, the stones that form the
tops of the many niches shown in the cut are from
five and a half to seven feet long, four to five and a
half wide, and four to nine inches thick. Respecting
the stairway nothing can be said in addition to what
is shown in the cut. It leads up the eastern slope,
and is the only means of ascent to the summit. It
is divided by solid balustrades into five divisions, only
two of which extend uninterruptedly to the upper
story, while the central division can hardly have been
used at all as a stairway.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-42" href="#Footnote_VIII-42" class="fnanchor">[VIII-42]</a></p>

<p>The niches shown in my cut extend entirely round
the circumference of each story, except where interrupted
on the east by the stairways. Each niche is
about three feet square and two feet deep, except
those in the centre of the eastern front, which are
smaller. Their whole number seems to have been
three hundred and twenty-one, according to Nebel's
plate, without including those that may have occurred
on the seventh story.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-43" href="#Footnote_VIII-43" class="fnanchor">[VIII-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF MAPILCA.</p>

<p>Only slight mention is made of any scattered or
movable relics at Papantla. It is said that fragments
of ruins are scattered over an area of half a league
from the pyramid, but no exploration has been made.
A small golden idol is reported by Gondra to have
been found here, very like a terra-cotta image of Quetzalcoatl,
from Culhuacan, of which a cut will be given
in the next chapter. Bausa speaks of a stone trough
found on the summit of the pyramid, ruins of houses
in regular streets in the vicinity, and immense sculptured
blocks of stone.</p>

<p class="caption">Sculptured Granite Block&mdash;Mapilca.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Nebel also visited another locality where remains
were discovered, south-eastward from Papantla
towards the Tecolutla river, near the rancho of Mapilca.
Here in a thick forest were several pyramids
in a very advanced stage of dilapidation and not
described. There were also seen immense blocks of
granite scattered in the forest. The one sketched by
Nebel and shown in the cut is twenty-one feet long,
and covered with ornamental sculpture in low relief:
it rested on a kind of pavement of irregular narrow
stones. Another explorer, who saw the ruins in 1828,
found the remains of twenty houses, one of them seventy
paces long, with walls still standing to the height
of ten feet. Most of them were only six feet high,
and the small amount of débris indicated that only
part of the original height was of stone.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-44" href="#Footnote_VIII-44" class="fnanchor">[VIII-44]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF TUSAPAN.</p>

<p>On a low hill some forty miles west of Papantla,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>
at the foot of the cordillera, enveloped in an almost
impenetrable forest, is another group of ruins, called
Tusapan, known only from the drawings and slight
description of Nebel. The only structure which remains
standing is shown in the cut. It consists of a
pyramid thirty feet square at the base, and bearing a
building in a tolerable state of preservation. Except
the doorposts, lintels, and cornices, the whole structure
is said to be built of irregular fragments of limestone;
but if this be true, it is evident from the
drawing that the whole was covered with a smooth
coat of plaster. The building on the summit contains
a single apartment twelve feet square, with a door at
the head of the stairway. The apartment contains a
block, or pedestal, which may have served for an altar,
or to support an idol; and it has a pointed ceiling
similar in form to the exterior. It is unfortunate that
we have no further details respecting this ceiling,
since it would be interesting to know if it was formed
by overlapping stones as in the Maya ruins, particularly
as this is one of the very few remaining specimens
of the aboriginal arch in Nahua territory. From
the large number of stone blocks and other débris
found in the vicinity it is supposed that the pyramid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>
represented in the cut was not the grandest at Tusapan.
Several filled-up wells, and numerous fragments
of stone images of human and animal forms much
mutilated were also noticed.</p>

<img src="images/i457.jpg" width="313" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fountain in the Living Rock&mdash;Tusapan.</p>
</div>

<p>The water which supplied the aboriginal inhabitants
of the place, seems to have come from a spring
located on the side of a precipitous mountain; and at
the base of the cliff, where the water reached the
plain, was the very remarkable fountain shown in the
cut, artificially shaped from the living rock. The cut
is an exact fac-simile of Nebel's plate, except that the
surroundings, which add much to its interest, are
necessarily omitted. I quote Nebel's brief description
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span>
in full. "Among the ruins of Tusapan is found
the grotesque fountain here represented. The whole
monument consists of a statue nineteen feet high,
sculptured in the living rock. The clothing indicates
clearly a woman, seated, resting her head on the left
arm, which is supported by her knee. The head
seems to be adorned with feathers and precious stones.
Among the plumes behind is a hollow intended to
receive the waters of a neighboring spring (which no
longer exists). The water ran through the whole figure
and out under the petticoats in the most natural
manner, whence it was conducted in a canal of hewn
stone to the town near by."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-45" href="#Footnote_VIII-45" class="fnanchor">[VIII-45]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF METLALTOYUCA.</p>

<p class="p2">The Mesa de Metlaltoyuca is on the Tuxpan River,
about twelve leagues south-west from the port of
Tuxpan, twenty-two leagues north-east of Tulancingo,
and probably in the state of Vera Cruz, although
very near the boundary. The table-land is very
extensive, and is covered throughout most of its extent
by a thick forest. Juan B. Campo, Sub-Prefect
of Huauchinango, discovered a group of ruins here,
and gave a description of his discoveries in a report
dated June 27, 1865.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-46" href="#Footnote_VIII-46" class="fnanchor">[VIII-46]</a> His account is very general,
alluding to the ruins of a great city, whose streets
were paved with polished stones, a fine stone palace
plastered and painted, all surrounded by a wall fifteen
feet thick and ten feet high, with a great gate,
covered way, stone bastions, etc., etc. Immediately
after the publication of Campo's report, Ramon Almaraz,
chief of a Mexican scientific commission, engaged
with other engineers in surveying for a road in
this region, spent five days in the exploration of the
ruined city, preparing plans and other drawings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">459</a></span>
also taking some photographic views. His report,
very far from being full and satisfactory, illustrated
with several plates, was published in the government
reports for the year mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-47" href="#Footnote_VIII-47" class="fnanchor">[VIII-47]</a></p>

<img src="images/i459.jpg" width="371" height="192" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Plan&mdash;Ruins of Metlaltoyuca.</p>
</div>

<p>The name, Metlaltoyuca, according to Galicia Chimalpopoca,
signifies 'place fortified with solid stones,'
but Sr Linares attributes to the word a different derivation,
and makes it mean 'land of the maguey.'<a id="FNanchor_VIII-48" href="#Footnote_VIII-48" class="fnanchor">[VIII-48]</a>
Almaraz says: "A succinct account of the ruins
might be given by saying that they consist of pyramids
built of hewn blocks of sandstone, partially
covered with a good hydraulic cement, as will be
seen by the chemical analysis which will be given,<a id="FNanchor_VIII-49" href="#Footnote_VIII-49" class="fnanchor">[VIII-49]</a>
and of some tumuli, and remains of edifices of slight
elevation." The arrangement of the remains is
shown in the plan; only a few of the structures indicated
on the plan are mentioned in the description,
and of those few very little is said. The space covered
by the ruins is in rectangular form, about two
hundred and fifty by five hundred yards, and is located
in the south-western portion of the mesa. The
chief structure, <i>a</i> of the plan, stands at the north-west
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>
corner, and its northern and western walls, four
hundred and eighty-five and one hundred and ninety-four
feet respectively, meet at an angle of 87° 30´;
on the other sides the walls are irregular, forming
many angles, and in the interior there are walls
which divided the enclosed area into several compartments.
There are, according to the text, traces of
walls, in some places five or six feet high, extending
from the ends of the main structure and inclosing the
other works, but not shown in the plan. Some steps
and also water-tanks were found in connection with
the corner walls. Campo also found two doors
blocked up with stone slabs. There are several truncated
pyramids, the largest of which, at <i>b</i>, is thirty-six
feet high, and one hundred and thirty-one feet
square at the base. It is built in six stories, and has
traces of the buildings which formerly occupied its
summit. All the structures are built of brick-shaped
blocks of sandstone, very nicely cut, and laid in
mud.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-50" href="#Footnote_VIII-50" class="fnanchor">[VIII-50]</a> On the surface of the cement, which covers
all the buildings to a thickness of over an inch,
painted figures are seen.</p>

<p class="caption">Section of a Mound&mdash;Metlaltoyuca.</p>
</div>

<p>A remarkable feature at Metlaltoyuca is the existence
of the parallel mounds at <i>c</i>, of the plan. As
nearly as can be ascertained from the drawings and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">461</a></span>
text, they are about one hundred and forty feet long,
twenty feet wide, and ten or twelve feet high. The
interior is filled with loose stones and earth, and the
surface is covered with somewhat irregular brick-shaped
blocks, laid in mud or clay, and apparently covered
with cement. The cut shows a transverse section
of one of the mounds, and indicates a near approach
to the principle of the regular key-stone arch, although
as the interior was filled to the top, there is no evidence
that the arch was intentionally self-supporting.
Some traces of hieroglyphic paintings were found on
the mortar which covered a part of these mounds.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-51" href="#Footnote_VIII-51" class="fnanchor">[VIII-51]</a></p>

<p>Something over two miles north-west of the ruins
described, at the only point where the mesa is accessible
on the northern side, is a double stone wall
guarding the passage. The outer wall is three or four
hundred yards long, thirteen feet high, and fifty feet
thick at the base, diminishing towards the top. The
inner wall is of smaller dimensions. The same system
of defensive works is repeated on the opposite
side of the mesa. The only movable relics found
were, the figure of a female bearing a sculptured
cross, a representation of a mummy closely wrapped
as if for burial and having features of a different type
from those ordinarily found in Aztec idols, and the
form of a man with arms crossed and legs bent, sculptured
on a slab, all of the same sandstone of which
the buildings were constructed. According to Campo,
another smaller group of remains has been seen farther
south, towards the Mesa de Amistlan. Two idols of
porous basalt and numerous arrow-heads of obsidian
are reported at Guautla, twenty-five or thirty miles
north-west of Metlaltoyuca.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-52" href="#Footnote_VIII-52" class="fnanchor">[VIII-52]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RELICS AT PÁNUCO</p>

<p class="p2">In the northern extremity of the state, in the region
about Pánuco, small relics are said to be very abundant.
A list of thirty specimens collected by Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Francis Vecelli during a survey of the Pánuco River,
some of them doubtless belonging to the state of Tamaulipas,
across the river, is given by Mr Vetch in the
Journal of the London Geographical Society. They
are mostly of limestone and represent human figures,
for the most part females, rudely sculptured and wearing
peculiar head-dresses. The foreheads are represented
as high and broad, the lips thick, and the
cheek-bones high. The sculpture is rude, and nearly
every one of the images has a long unshaped base or
tenon, as if intended to be fixed in a wall. A front
and rear view of one of these images are shown in the
cut.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-53" href="#Footnote_VIII-53" class="fnanchor">[VIII-53]</a> In the town itself, idols, heads, obsidian arrow-heads,
and fragments of ancient pottery, some of it
glazed, are often washed out by the heavy rains. Mr
Lyon speaks of "several curious ancient toys and
whistles, with one small terra cotta vase very beautifully
carved with those peculiar flourishes introduced
in the Mexican manuscripts," also "an antique flute of
a very compact red clay, which had once been polished
and painted. It had four holes, and the mouth part was
in the form of a grotesque head." Flutes occur both
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>
single and double, with two, three, and four holes.
Earthen representations of birds, toads, and other
animals are frequently found either whole or in fragments.
West of the town five or six mounds from
thirty to forty feet high are vaguely mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-54" href="#Footnote_VIII-54" class="fnanchor">[VIII-54]</a>
Buried in the ground in a ravine near the town, and
resting on the stone walls of a dilapidated sepulchre,
Mr Norman claims to have found a stone slab seven
feet long, wider at one end than the other, but two
feet and a half in average width, one foot thick, and
bearing on one side the sculptured figure of a man.
Dressed in a flowing robe, with girdle, sandal-ties on
his feet, and a close-fitting cap on his head, he lies
with crossed arms. The face is Caucasian in feature,
and the work is very perfectly executed. For the
authenticity of so remarkable a relic Mr Norman
is hardly a sufficient authority. Two small images,
probably of terra cotta, were presented by Mr Norman
to the New York Historical Society.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-55" href="#Footnote_VIII-55" class="fnanchor">[VIII-55]</a></p>

<p>At the Calondras Rancho, some twenty-five miles
from Pánuco, a large oven-like chamber is reported
on the slope of a hill, which contains large flat stones
used for grinding maize. The ruins at Chacuaco,
three leagues south of the town, are said to cover
about three square leagues. Mr Norman also gives
cuts of two clay vases from the same locality, one of
them having a negro face, very likely of modern
origin. San Nicolas, five leagues, and Trinidad six
leagues south-west of Pánuco, are other places where
ruins are reported to exist.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-56" href="#Footnote_VIII-56" class="fnanchor">[VIII-56]</a></p>

Monuments.</span>
</p>

<p>The monuments of the Mexican tierra templada,
of Anáhuac and the adjoining plateaux, next claim
our attention. The territory in question is bounded
on the south and east by that treated in the two preceding
chapters&mdash;Oajaca and Guerrero on the south
toward the Pacific, and Vera Cruz on the east toward
the gulf. The present chapter will carry my antiquarian
survey to a line drawn across the continent
from Tampico to the mouth of the Zacatula river,
completing what has been regarded as the home of
the Nahua civilized nations, with the exception of the
Tarascos in Michoacan, and leaving only a few scattered
monuments to be described in the broad extent
of the northern states of the republic. On most of
the maps extant the territory whose monuments I
have now to describe, is divided into the states of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Mexico, Puebla, Tlascala, and Querétaro, to which
have been added in later years Morelos and Hidalgo,
formed chiefly, I believe, from the old state of Mexico.
In my description, however, I shall pay but
little attention to state lines, locating each group of
antiquities by its distance and bearing from some
well-known point. Respecting the physical features
of this central Nahua region, enough has been said
in the preceding volumes; I consequently begin at
once the description of antiquarian relics, dealing
first with those found in Puebla and Tlascala, starting
in the south and proceeding northward.</p>

<p class="caption p2">Section of Chila Tomb.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">REMAINS AT CHILA.</p>

<p>At Chila, in the extreme southern part of Puebla,
is a hill known as La Tortuga, on which is built an
unterraced pyramid eighty-eight feet square at the
base, fifty-five feet high, with a summit platform
fifty feet square. It is built of hewn stone and covered,
as it appears from Castañeda's drawing, with
cement. The exterior surface is much broken up by
the trees that have taken root there. A stairway
leads up the western front. Near the north-eastern
corner of the mound is an entrance leading down by
seven stone steps to a small tomb about eleven feet
below the surface of the ground and not under the
mound. At the foot of the steps is an apartment
measuring five and a half feet long and high, and four
feet wide, with a branch, or gallery, four feet long and
a little less than three feet wide and high, in the centre
of each of the three sides, thus giving the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">466</a></span>
tomb in its ground plan the form of a cross. Its vertical
section is shown in the cut. There is certainly a
general resemblance to be noted in this tomb-structure
to those at Mitla; the interior is lined with hewn
blocks laid in lime mortar and covered with a fine
white plaster, the plaster on the ceiling being eight
or nine inches thick. The discovery of human bones
in the lateral galleries leaves no doubt respecting the
use to which the subterranean structure was devoted.<a id="FNanchor_IX-1" href="#Footnote_IX-1" class="fnanchor">[IX-1]</a></p>

<p>At Tehuacan el Viejo, two leagues eastward of the
modern town of Tehuacan, in the south-eastern part of
the state, were found ruins of stone structures not
particularly described.<a id="FNanchor_IX-2" href="#Footnote_IX-2" class="fnanchor">[IX-2]</a> At San Cristóval Teopantepec,
a little native settlement north-westward of the
remains last mentioned, is another hill which bears a
pyramid on its top. A road cut in the rocky sides
leads up the hill, and on the summit, beside the pyramid,
traces of smooth cement pavements and other
undescribed remains were noticed. The pyramid itself
from a base fifty feet square rises about sixty-seven feet
in four receding stories with sides apparently sloping
very slightly inward toward the top, the fourth story
being moreover for the most part in ruins. The most
remarkable feature of this structure is its stairway,
which is different from any yet noticed, and similar
to that of the grand teocalli of Mexico-Tenochtitlan
as reported by the conquerors. It leads up diagonally
from bottom to top of each story on the west, not,
however, making it necessary to pass four times round
the pyramid in order to reach the summit, as was the
case in Mexico, since in this ruin the head of each
flight corresponds with the foot of the one above, instead
of being on the opposite side of the pyramid.
The whole is built of stone and mortar, only the exterior
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>
facing being of regular blocks, and no covering of
cement is indicated in Castañeda's drawing.<a id="FNanchor_IX-3" href="#Footnote_IX-3" class="fnanchor">[IX-3]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TEPEXE AND TEPEACA.</p>

<p>At Tepexe el Viejo, on the Zacatula River, some
sixteen leagues south-east of the city of Puebla, Dupaix
discovered, in 1808, a structure which he calls a
fortification. It was located on a rocky height, surrounded
by deep ravines, and the rough nature of the
ground, together with the serpents that infest the
rocks, prevented him from making exact measurements.
There are traces of exterior enclosing walls,
and within the enclosed area stands a pyramid of
hewn stone and lime mortar, in eight receding stories.
A fragment of a circular stone was also found at
Tepexe, bearing sculptured figures in low relief, which
indicate that the monument may have borne originally
some resemblance to the Aztec calendar-stone,
to be mentioned hereafter. Another round stone bore
marks of having been used for sharpening weapons.<a id="FNanchor_IX-4" href="#Footnote_IX-4" class="fnanchor">[IX-4]</a></p>

<p>At Tepeaca and vicinity four relics were found:&mdash;1st.
A bird's, perhaps an eagle's, head sculptured in
low relief within a triple circle, together with other
figures, on a slab about a foot square; apparently an
aboriginal coat of arms. 2d. A stone head eighteen
inches high, of a hard, reddish material; the features
are very regular down to the mouth, below which all
is deformed. 3d. A sculptured slab, built into a
wall, shown only in Kingsborough's plate. 4th. A
feathered serpent coiled into a ball-like form, six feet
in diameter. It was carved from a red stone, and
also painted red, resting on a cubical pedestal of a
light-colored stone.<a id="FNanchor_IX-5" href="#Footnote_IX-5" class="fnanchor">[IX-5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>

<p>At San Antonio, near San Andres Chalchicomula,
on the eastern boundary of the state, a pyramid
stands on the summit of a rocky hill. The pyramid
consists of three stories, with sides sloping at an
angle of about forty-five degrees, is about twenty-five
feet in height, and has a base fifty-five feet square.
A stairway about ten feet wide, with solid balustrades,
leads up the centre of the western front; and
on the top, parts of the walls of a building still remained
in 1805. This summit building was said to
have been in a good state of preservation only twelve
years before. The material is basalt, in blocks about
two by five feet, according to Dupaix's plate, laid in mortar,
and all but the lower story covered with cement.<a id="FNanchor_IX-6" href="#Footnote_IX-6" class="fnanchor">[IX-6]</a></p>

<p>At Quauhquelchula, near Atlixco, in the western
part of the state, Dupaix noticed four relics of antiquity.
1st. A rattlesnake eight feet and a half long,
and about eight inches in diameter, sculptured in
high relief on the flat surface of a hard brown stone.
2d. A hard veined stone of various colors, four feet
high and ten feet and a half in circumference, carved
into a representation of a monster's head with protruding
tusks, a front view of which is given in the cut.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span>
The rear is flat and bears a coat of arms, made
up of four arrows or spears crossing a circle, with
other inexplicable figures. 3d. Another coat of arms,
three lances across a barred circle, carved in low relief
on the face of a boulder. 4th. A human face, larger
than the natural size, on the side of another boulder,
and looking towards the town.<a id="FNanchor_IX-7" href="#Footnote_IX-7" class="fnanchor">[IX-7]</a> At the town of Atlixco
a very beautifully worked and polished almond-shaped
agate was seen.<a id="FNanchor_IX-8" href="#Footnote_IX-8" class="fnanchor">[IX-8]</a></p>

<p>On the hacienda of Santa Catalina, westward from
Atlixco, was found the coiled serpent shown in the
cut. The material is a black porous volcanic stone,
and the whole seems to form a cup, to which the head
of the serpent served as a handle. Another relic
from this locality was a masked human figure of the
same stone.<a id="FNanchor_IX-9" href="#Footnote_IX-9" class="fnanchor">[IX-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">PYRAMID OF CHOLULA.</p>

<p class="p2">About ten miles west of the city of Puebla de los
Angeles, and in the eastern outskirts of the pueblo of
Cholula, is the famous pyramid known throughout the
world by the name of Cholula. The town at its base
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span>
was in aboriginal times a large and flourishing city,
and a great religious centre. The day of its glory
was in the Toltec period, before the tenth century of
our era, and tradition points for the building of the
pyramid to a yet more remote epoch, when the Olmecs
were the masters of the central plateaux. Several
times during the religious contests that raged
between the devotees of rival deities, the temple of
Cholula was destroyed and rebuilt. Its final destruction
dates from the coming of the Spaniards, who,
under Hernan Cortés, after a fierce hand-to-hand conflict
on the slopes of the pyramid, maddened by the
desperate resistance of the natives, elated by victory,
or incited by fanatical religious zeal and avarice,
sacked and burned the magnificent structure on the
top of the mound. Since the time of the Conquistador,
after the fierce spirit of the Spaniards had expended
its fury on this and other monuments reared
in honor of heathen gods, the mound was allowed
to remain in peace, save the construction of a winding
road leading up to a modern chapel on the summit,
where services are performed in which the great
Quetzalcoatl has no share.<a id="FNanchor_IX-10" href="#Footnote_IX-10" class="fnanchor">[IX-10]</a></p>

<p>Since 1744, when the historian Clavigero rode up
its side on horseback, this pyramid has been visited
by hundreds of travelers, few tourists having left
Anáhuac without having seen so famous a monument
of antiquity, so easily accessible from the cities of
Mexico and Puebla. Humboldt's description, made
from a personal exploration in 1803, is perhaps the
most complete that was ever published, and most
succeeding visitors have deemed it best to quote his
account as being better than any they could write
from their own observations. Dupaix and Castañeda,
and in later times Nebel, also examined and
made drawings of Cholula. The four or five views
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span>
of the mound that have been published differ greatly
from each other, accordingly as the artist pictured
the monument as he saw it or attempted to restore
it more or less to its original form. Humboldt's
drawing, which has been more extensively copied
than any other, contrary to what might be expected
from his text, was altogether a restoration, and bore
not the slightest resemblance to the original as he
saw it, since Clavigero found it in 1744, "so covered
with earth and shrubs that it seems rather a natural
hill than an edifice," and there is no reason to suppose
that at a later date it assumed a more regular
form.<a id="FNanchor_IX-11" href="#Footnote_IX-11" class="fnanchor">[IX-11]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span></p>

<p>For the past two centuries, at least, the condition
and appearance of the mound has been that of a natural
conical hill, rising from the level of a broad valley,
and covering with its circular base an area of
over forty acres.<a id="FNanchor_IX-12" href="#Footnote_IX-12" class="fnanchor">[IX-12]</a> On closer examination, however,
traces of artificial terraces are noted on the slopes,
and excavations have proven that the whole mound,
or at least a very large portion of it&mdash;for no excavation
has ever been made reaching to its centre&mdash;is of
artificial construction. By the careful surveys of
Humboldt and others the original form and dimensions
have been clearly made known. From a base
about fourteen hundred and forty feet square, whose
sides face the cardinal points, it rose in four equal
stories to a height of nearly two hundred feet, having
a summit platform of about two hundred feet square.<a id="FNanchor_IX-13" href="#Footnote_IX-13" class="fnanchor">[IX-13]</a>
Humboldt in 1803 found the four terraces tolerably
distinct, especially on the western slope; Evans in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">473</a></span>
1870 found the lower terrace quite perfect, but the
others traceable only in a few places without excavation.</p>

<p>The material of which the mound was constructed
is adobes, or sun-dried bricks, generally about fifteen
inches long, laid very regularly with alternate layers
of clay. From its material comes the name Tlalchihualtepec,
'mountain of unburnt bricks,' which has
been sometimes applied to Cholula. An old tradition
relates that the adobes were manufactured at Tlalmanalco,
and brought several leagues to their destination
by a long line of men, who handed them along singly
from one to another. Humboldt thought some of the
bricks might have been slightly burned. Respecting
the material which constitutes the alternate layers between
the bricks, called clay by Humboldt, there seems
to be some difference of opinion between different explorers.
Col. Brantz Mayer, a careful investigator,
says the adobes are interspersed with small fragments
of porphyry and limestone; and Mr Tylor speaks
of them as cemented with mortar containing small
stones and pottery. Evans tells us that the material
is adobe bricks and layers of lava, still perfect in many
places. The historian Veytia by a personal examination
ascertained the material to be "small stones of
the kind called <i>guijarros</i>, and a kind of bricks of clay
and straw," in alternate layers.<a id="FNanchor_IX-14" href="#Footnote_IX-14" class="fnanchor">[IX-14]</a> Beaufoy claims to
have found the pyramid faced with small thin hewn
stones, one of which he carried away as a relic&mdash;a
very wonderful discovery certainly, when we consider
that other very trustworthy explorers, both preceding
and following Beaufoy, found nothing of the
kind. Mr Heller could not find the stone facing, but,
as he says, he did find a coating of mortar as hard as
stone, composed of lime, sand, and water.<a id="FNanchor_IX-15" href="#Footnote_IX-15" class="fnanchor">[IX-15]</a> Many
visitors have believed that the pyramid is only partially
artificial, the adobe-work having been added to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">474</a></span>
a smaller natural hill. This is, however, a mere conjecture,
and there are absolutely no arguments to be
adduced for or against it. The truth can be ascertained
only by the excavation of a tunnel through the
mound at its base, or, at least, penetrating to the centre.
It is very remarkable that such an excavation
has never been made, either in the interests of scientific
exploration or of treasure-seeking.</p>

<p>Bernal Diaz, at the time of the Conquest, counted
a hundred and twenty steps in a stairway which led
up the slope to the temple, but no traces of such a
stairway have been visible in more modern times.
There are traditions among the natives, as is usually
the case in connection with every work of the antiguos,
of interior galleries and apartments of great
extent within the mound; such rumors are doubtless
without foundation. The Puebla road cuts off a
corner of the lower terrace, and the excavation made
in building the road not only showed clearly the
regular interior construction of the pyramid, but also
laid bare a tomb, which contained two skeletons with
two idols in basalt, a collection of pottery, and other
relics not preserved or particularly described, although
the remains of the tomb itself were examined
by Humboldt. The sepulchre was square, with stone
walls supported by cypress beams. The dimensions
are not given, but the apartment is said to have had
no traces of any outlet. Humboldt claims to have
discovered a peculiar arrangement of the adobes
about this tomb, by which the pressure on its roof
was diminished.</p>

<p>It is very evident that the pyramid of Cholula
contains nothing in itself to indicate its age, but from
well-defined and doubtless reliable traditions, we may
feel very sure that its erection dates back to an epoch
preceding the tenth century, and probably preceding
the seventh. Humboldt shows that it is larger at the
base than any of the old-world pyramids, over twice
as large as that of Cheops, but only slightly higher
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>
than that of Mycerinus. "The construction of the
teocalli recalls the oldest monuments to which the
history of the civilization of our race reaches. The
temple of Jupiter Bélus, which the mythology of the
Hindus seems to designate by the name of Bali,
the pyramids of Meïdoùm and Dahchoùr, and several
of the group of Sakharah in Egypt, were also
immense heaps of bricks, the remains of which have
been preserved during a period of thirty centuries
down to our day."<a id="FNanchor_IX-16" href="#Footnote_IX-16" class="fnanchor">[IX-16]</a></p>

<p>The historical annals of aboriginal times, confirmed
by the Spanish records of the Conquest, leave no doubt
that the chief object of the pyramid was to support
a temple; the discovery of the tomb with human remains
may indicate that it served also for burial purposes.
It is by no means certain, however, that the
mound was in any sense a monument reared over the
two bodies whose skeletons were found; for besides
the position of the skeletons in a corner of the pyramid,
indicating in itself the contrary, there is the
possibility that the bodies were those of slaves sacrificed
during the process of building, and deposited
here from some superstitious motive. It will require
the discovery of tombs near the centre of this immense
mound to prove that it was erected with any
view to use as the burial place of kings or priests.<a id="FNanchor_IX-17" href="#Footnote_IX-17" class="fnanchor">[IX-17]</a>
Wilson, always a sceptic on matters connected with
Mexican aboriginal civilization, pronounces the pyramid
of Cholula "the finest Indian mound on this continent;
where the Indians buried the bravest of their
braves, with bows and arrows, and a drinking cup,
that they might not be unprovided for when they
should arrive at the hunting-grounds of the great
spirit." "It is sufficiently wasted by time to give full
scope to the imagination to fill out or restore it to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>
almost any form. One hundred years ago, some rich
citizen constructed steps up its side, and protected the
sides of his steps from falling earth by walls of adobe,
or mud-brick; and on the west side some adobe buttresses
have been placed to keep the loose earth out
of the village street. This is all of mans labor that
is visible, except the work of the Indians in shaving
away the hill which constitutes this pyramid. As
for the great city of Cholula, it never had an existence."<a id="FNanchor_IX-18" href="#Footnote_IX-18" class="fnanchor">[IX-18]</a>
At a short distance from the foot of the
large pyramid, two smaller ones are mentioned by
several visitors; one of which is doubtless a portion
of the chief mound separated by the road that has
been already mentioned. One of them is described by
Beaufoy as having perpendicular sides, and built of
adobes nine inches square and one inch thick; the
second was much smaller and had a corn-patch on its
summit. Cuts of the two small mounds are given by
the same explorer. Bullock claims to have found on
the top of one of the detached masses a ditch and
wall forming a kind of figure-eight-formed enclosure
one hundred feet long, in which were many human
bones. Evans has a theory that the small mounds
were formed of the material taken from the larger
one in shaping its terraces. Latrobe says that many
ruined mounds may be seen from the summit; in fact,
that the whole surface of the surrounding plain is
broken by both natural and artificial elevations. Ampère
was led by his native guide, through a misunderstanding,
to a flat-topped terraced hill, still bearing
traces of a pavement, at a locality called Zapotecas.<a id="FNanchor_IX-19" href="#Footnote_IX-19" class="fnanchor">[IX-19]</a></p>

<p>The only miscellaneous Cholulan relics of which I
find a mention, are three described by Dupaix and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">477</a></span>
sketched by Castañeda. They were, a stone head,
said to have originally been the top of a column; a
quadrangular block, with incised hieroglyphics on one
of its faces; and a mask of green jasper, reported to
have been dug from the pyramid.<a id="FNanchor_IX-20" href="#Footnote_IX-20" class="fnanchor">[IX-20]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS AT NATIVIDAD.</p>

<p class="p2">On the summit of the Sierra de Malinche, which
forms the boundary between Puebla and Tlascala,
the existence of ruined walls and pyramids, with
fragments of stone images, is mentioned without description.<a id="FNanchor_IX-21" href="#Footnote_IX-21" class="fnanchor">[IX-21]</a>
At San Pablo del Monte two kneeling
naked females in stone, modestly covering the breasts
with the hands, were sketched by Castañeda.<a id="FNanchor_IX-22" href="#Footnote_IX-22" class="fnanchor">[IX-22]</a> Of
an important group of remains in the vicinity of
Natividad, between Puebla de los Angeles and Tlascala,
a very unintelligible account has been written
by Cabrera, for the Mexican Geographical Society.
The ruins seem to cover a hill, different localities on
the slopes of which are called Mixco, Xochitecatl,
Tenexotzin, Hueyxotzin, and Cacaxtlan. The western
slope has gigantic terraces, and among other relics
five vertical stones called <i>huitzocteme</i>, supposed to
have been used for sacrificial purposes. They are
two varas high and three fourths of a vara wide.
On the northern slope a concavity of stone and mud
is mentioned, whose bottom is strewn with pottery
and obsidian weapons. At Cacaxtlan, the site of the
principal fortress in the wars between Tlascala and
Mexico, are ditches and subterranean passages running
in all directions. The chief ditch extends from
north to south across the hill; it is about twenty-eight
feet wide and eleven or twelve feet deep, with
embankments formed of the earth thrown out. The
subterranean passages are believed to penetrate the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>
heights of Cacaxtlan. One has an opening among
the rocks on the north, beginning at the cave of
Ostotl; another begins on the east at San Miguel del
Milagro, having for an entrance a square hole five or
six yards deep, from the bottom of which it extends
horizontally in a semicircular course; the third opening
is on the south, and its top is supported by
columns left in the volcanic stone; and finally, the
fourth subterranean passage sends out vapor when it
is about to rain. This is all I can glean from Cabrera's
account&mdash;in fact, rather more than I can
fully understand.<a id="FNanchor_IX-23" href="#Footnote_IX-23" class="fnanchor">[IX-23]</a> Dupaix found at Natividad two
wooden teponastles, or aboriginal musical instruments,
similar to the one found at Tlascala by the
same explorer and shown in the accompanying cut.
The former were, however, less elaborately carved;
the latter was three feet long and five inches in
diameter, the cut showing a side and end view.
Other relics found by Dupaix in the city of Tlascala
and vicinity, are the following:&mdash;a lance-head, nine
inches long, of green flint; a small stone statue, nine
or ten inches in height, representing a seated female,
whose head bears a strong resemblance to some of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>
the Palenque profiles; a mask of green agate a little
smaller than the natural size of the face, pronounced
by Dupaix the finest specimen of sculpture seen in
America; an earthen vase called <i>popocaxtli</i>, used in
ceremonies in honor of the dead, found in connection
with some human bones; two mutilated human heads
carved from a gray stone; and a masked, bow-legged
idol of stone, twenty-four inches high, standing on
a small pedestal, covering the breasts with the
hands.<a id="FNanchor_IX-24" href="#Footnote_IX-24" class="fnanchor">[IX-24]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ABORIGINAL BRIDGES.</p>

<p>At Pueblo de los Reyes, northward from Tlascala,
on the road to San Francisco, two aboriginal bridges
over a mountain stream were sketched by Castañeda.
One is eleven feet high and thirty-seven feet wide;
the other fifty-five feet high and thirty-three feet
wide; each being over a hundred feet in length.
They are built of large irregular stones in mortar.
The conduits through which the stream passes are
from four to six feet wide and high, one of them having
a flat top, while in the other two large blocks
meet and form an obtuse angle. On the top of the
bridges at the sides are parapets of brick four or five
feet high, pierced at intervals to allow water to run
from the road; and at each of the four corners stands
a circular, symmetrical, ornamental obelisk, or pillar,
over forty feet high, of stone and mortar, covered
with burned bricks. It is quite probable that the
brick-work of these bridges, if not the whole structure,
is to be referred to Spanish rather than to aboriginal
times. Sr Almaraz sketched at Xicotepec, in
the north, some fifty miles west of Papantla, a teponastle
of iron-wood, gracefully carved and brilliantly
polished.<a id="FNanchor_IX-25" href="#Footnote_IX-25" class="fnanchor">[IX-25]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span></p>

<p>The famous wall that was found by Cortés, extending
along the frontier of Tlascala, has been spoken of
in another part of this work. Brasseur de Bourbourg
tells us that many remains of this wall are still visible,
and some other authors vaguely speak to the same
effect; but as no modern traveler describes or locates
these remains, I think it altogether likely that the
statements referred to may be simply echoes of those
made by the early writers, who represented the ruins
of the wall as visible in the years immediately following
the Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_IX-26" href="#Footnote_IX-26" class="fnanchor">[IX-26]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RELICS AT CUERNAVACA.</p>

<p class="p2">Passing westward into the state of Mexico, and
beginning again in the south, I find a notice in a Mexican
government report, of ruins at Tejupilco, in the
south-west, about sixty miles westward of Cuernavaca.
The remains are noticed especially on the hill
of Nanchititla, consisting of buildings standing on
regular streets yet traceable, and built of very thin
blocks, or slates, of stone without mortar. In the
valley of San Martin Luvianos, in the same region,
a subterranean apartment with polished sides of cement,
discovered in 1841, contained quantities of carbonized
maize.<a id="FNanchor_IX-27" href="#Footnote_IX-27" class="fnanchor">[IX-27]</a> At Zacualpan, midway between
Cuernavaca and Tejupilco, and some leagues further
south, flint spear-heads, stone masks, and other relics
not specified are said by the same authority to have
been found in a cave.<a id="FNanchor_IX-28" href="#Footnote_IX-28" class="fnanchor">[IX-28]</a> A peculiarity of the aboriginal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>
relics found by Dupaix at Cuernavaca and vicinity
was that all consisted of sculptured figures on the
surface of large naturally shaped boulders. The first
was an immense lizard over eight feet long and a foot
and a half thick, carved in high relief on the top
of a rough block. Four small circular projections are
seen on the side of the rock below the animal. On
the southern face of another isolated boulder was
sculptured in low relief the coat of arms shown in the
cut, which, in its principal features of a circle on
parallel arrows or lances, is very similar to others
that have been mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_IX-29" href="#Footnote_IX-29" class="fnanchor">[IX-29]</a> On the flag that projects
from the upper part of the circle, a Maltese cross
is seen, and the bird's head above is pronounced of
course by Dupaix to be that of an eagle.<a id="FNanchor_IX-30" href="#Footnote_IX-30" class="fnanchor">[IX-30]</a> On the
opposite, or northern, side of the same boulder are
sculptured the figures shown in the cut. The left
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">482</a></span>
hand figure, thirteen inches high, may in connection
with the small circles be a record of a date&mdash;thirteen
calli. M. Lenoir, however, on account of the column
shown within the building, believes the whole may be
an emblem of phallic worship, the column being a
phallus and the building its shrine or temple. The
sculpture on both sides of this rock is described as
having been executed with great care and clearness.
Somewhat less than a league south of the city is
another isolated rock, said to have served as a boundary
mark to the ancient Quauhnahuac, 'place of the
eagle,' of which the modern name Cuernavaca is a
corruption. On the face of this rock is carved in
rather high relief the figure represented in the cut,
which, in consideration of the aboriginal meaning of
the name, and the purpose served by the stone, may
be regarded as an eagle. The material is a fine gray
stone, the bird is thirty-five inches high, and the
boulder, or its locality, is called by the natives Quauhtetl,
'stone eagle.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-31" href="#Footnote_IX-31" class="fnanchor">[IX-31]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF XOCHICALCO.</p>

<p>The ruins of Xochicalco, doubtless the finest in
Mexico, are about fifteen miles 13° west of south
from Cuernavaca, and about seventy-five miles south-west
from the city of Mexico. The first published
description was written by Alzate y Ramirez, who
visited the locality in 1777, and published his account
with illustrative plates as a supplement to his Literary
Gazette in November, 1791.<a id="FNanchor_IX-32" href="#Footnote_IX-32" class="fnanchor">[IX-32]</a> Humboldt made
up his account from that of Alzate; Dupaix and Castañeda
included Xochicalco in their first exploration;
Nebel visited and sketched the ruins in 1831; and
finally an account, perhaps the most complete extant,
written from an exploration in 1835 by order of the
Mexican government, was published in the <i>Revista
Mexicana</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IX-33" href="#Footnote_IX-33" class="fnanchor">[IX-33]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF XOCHICALCO.</p>

<p>Xochicalco, the 'hill of flowers,'<a id="FNanchor_IX-34" href="#Footnote_IX-34" class="fnanchor">[IX-34]</a> is a natural elevation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">484</a></span>

miles in circumference, rising from the plain to a
height of nearly four hundred feet.<a id="FNanchor_IX-35" href="#Footnote_IX-35" class="fnanchor">[IX-35]</a> Mr Latrobe
claims to have found traces of paved roads, of large
stones tightly wedged together, one of them eight
feet wide, leading in straight lines towards the hill
from different directions. The account in the <i>Revista</i>
mentions only one such causeway running towards
the east. A ditch, more or less filled up and overgrown
with shrubbery, is said to extend entirely
round the base of the hill, but its depth and width
are not stated; perhaps in the absence of more complete
information its existence should be considered
doubtful.</p>

<p class="caption">Subterranean Galleries&mdash;Xochicalco.</p>
</div>

<p>Very near the foot of the northern slope are the
entrances to two tunnels or galleries, one of which
terminates at a distance of eighty-two feet; at least,
it was obstructed and could not be explored beyond
that point. The second gallery, cut in the solid limestone
of the hill, about nine feet and a half wide and
high, has several branches running in different directions,
some of them terminated by fallen débris, others
apparently walled up intentionally. The floors
are paved to the thickness of a foot and a half with
brick-shaped blocks of stone, the walls are also in
many places supported by masonry, and both pavement,
walls, and ceiling are covered with lime cement,
which retains its polish and shows traces in some
parts of having had originally a coating of red ochre.
The principal gallery, after turning once at a right angle,
terminates at a distance of several hundred feet
in a large apartment about eighty feet long, in which
two circular pillars are left in the living rock to support
the roof. The accompanying cut is Castañeda's
ground plan of the galleries and subterranean apartment,
<i>a</i> being the entrance on the north; <i>b</i> the termination
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span>
of main gallery; <i>c</i>, <i>k</i>, the branch gallery; <i>e</i> and
<i>d</i>, obstructed passages; <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, the room and <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, the

the inch, but the dimensions, according to the scale,
are doubtless inaccurate. According to the plan the
galleries are only a little over four feet wide; and the
apartment thirty-three by thirty-nine feet. Alzate's
plan agrees with it so far as it goes; the <i>Revista</i> gives
no plan, and its description differs in some respects,
so far as the arrangement of the galleries is concerned,
from the cut.<a id="FNanchor_IX-36" href="#Footnote_IX-36" class="fnanchor">[IX-36]</a> In the top of the room at the south-east
corner, at <i>h</i>, is a dome-like structure, a vertical
section of which is shown at <i>j</i> of the preceding cut,
six feet in diameter and six feet high, lined with stone
hewn in curved blocks, with a round hole about ten
inches in diameter extending vertically upward from
the top. It has been generally believed that this passage
leads up to the pyramid on the top of the hill,
to be described later; but it will be seen that if the
hill be two miles in circumference, or even half that
size, the galleries are not nearly long enough to reach
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span>
the centre under the pyramid. Nebel fancied that the
hole in the cupola was so situated that the rays of the
sun twice a year would penetrate from above and
strike an altar in the subterranean hall. The natives
report other passages in the hill besides the one described,
and believe that one of them leads to Chapultepec,
near the city of Mexico.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE HILL OF FLOWERS.</p>

<p>Passing now from the interior to the outer surface
of the 'hill of flowers,' we find it covered from top to
bottom with masonry. Five terraces, paved with
stone and mortar, and supported by perpendicular
walls of the same material, extend in oval form entirely
round the whole circumference of the hill, one
above the other. Neither the width of the paved
platforms nor the height of the supporting walls has
been given by any explorer, but each terrace, with
the corresponding intermediate slope, constitutes
something over seventy feet of the height of the
hill. The terrace platforms have sometimes been
described, without any authority, as a paved way
leading round and round the hill in a spiral course to
the summit. Dupaix speaks of a road about eight
feet wide, which leads to the summit, but no other
explorer mentions any traces of the original means of
ascent. Each terrace wall, while forming in general
terms an ellipse, does not present a regular line, but
is broken into various angles like the bastions of
a fortification. The pavements all slope slightly
towards the south-west, thus permitting the water to
run off readily. According to the plans of Alzate and
Castañeda there are two additional terraces where a
spur projects from the hill at the north-eastern base.
Latrobe is the only authority on the intermediate
slopes between the terraces, which he says are occupied
with platforms, bastions, and stages one above
another. It is evident from all accounts that the
whole surface of the hill, very likely shaped to some
extent artificially, was covered with stone work, and
that defense was one object aimed at by the builders.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>
The <i>Revista</i> represents the terrace platforms as additionally
fortified by the perpendicular supporting
walls projecting upward above their level, forming
what may perhaps be termed a kind of parapet.</p>

<p>On the summit is a level platform measuring
two hundred and eighty-five by three hundred and
twenty-eight feet.<a id="FNanchor_IX-37" href="#Footnote_IX-37" class="fnanchor">[IX-37]</a> According to Alzate, Humboldt,
Dupaix, and other early authorities&mdash;except
Nebel, who is silent on the subject&mdash;this plaza is
surrounded by a wall. Dupaix says the wall is built
of stones without mortar, is five feet and a half high,
and two feet and nine inches thick. Alzate represents
the wall as perpendicular only on the inner side,
being in fact a projection of the upper terrace slope,
forming a kind of parapet, and making the plaza a
sunken area. Latrobe also speaks of the plaza as a
hollow square, and Alzate's representation is probably
a correct one; for the author of the account in the
<i>Revista</i> says that the wall described by previous visitors
could not be found; and moreover, that there
was no room for it on the north between the central
pyramid and "one of the solid stone masses, or <i>caballeros</i>,
that surround the platform," the <i>caballeros</i>,
which may perhaps in this connection be translated
'parapets,' being doubtless the same structures that
the others describe as a wall.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PYRAMID OF XOCHICALCO.</p>

<p>In this plaza, cultivated in later years as a cornfield,
there are several mounds and heaps of stones
not particularly described; and near the centre is a
pyramid, or rather the lower story of one, with rectangular
base, the sides of which, exactly or very
nearly facing the cardinal points, measure sixty-five
feet from east to west, and fifty-eight feet from north
to south. The lower story, which in some parts is
still standing to its full height, is divided into what
may be termed plinth, frieze, and cornice, and is about
sixteen feet high.<a id="FNanchor_IX-38" href="#Footnote_IX-38" class="fnanchor">[IX-38]</a></p>

<img src="images/i488.jpg" width="546" height="436" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pyramid of Xochicalco.</p>
</div>

<p>In the centre of one of the façades is an open space,
something over twenty feet wide, bounded by solid
balustrades, and probably occupied originally by a
stairway, although it is said that no traces of steps
have been found among the débris. The cut, from
Nebel, shows the front of the pyramid on one side of
the opening, being the eastern portion of the northern
front, according to Nebel, who locates the stairway on
the north, or the northern part of the western front,
according to the <i>Revista</i>, which speaks of the opening
as being on the west.</p>

<p>The pyramid, or at least its facing, is built of large
blocks of granite or porphyry,<a id="FNanchor_IX-39" href="#Footnote_IX-39" class="fnanchor">[IX-39]</a> a kind of stone not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">489</a></span>
found within a distance of many leagues. The blocks
are of different sizes, the largest being about eleven
feet long and three feet high, and few being less than
five feet in length. They are laid without mortar,
and so nicely is the work done that the joints are
scarcely perceptible. The cut shows one of the façades,
probably the northern, from Castañeda's drawing,
which corresponds almost exactly to that given
by Alzate. So far as the details of the sculpture are
concerned it is probably not very trustworthy. The
preceding cut, from Nebel, is perhaps the only reliable
drawing in this respect that has been published.
The whole exterior surface seems to have been covered
with sculptured figures in low relief, apparently
executed after the stones were put in place, since one
figure extends, with the greatest exactitude at the
joints, over several blocks of stone.<a id="FNanchor_IX-40" href="#Footnote_IX-40" class="fnanchor">[IX-40]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i489"></a>
<img src="images/i489.jpg" width="550" height="196" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pyramid of Xochicalco.</p>
</div>

<p>I translate from the <i>Revista</i> the following remarks
about the sculptured figures: "At each angle, and
on each side, is seen a colossal dragon's head, from
whose great mouth, armed with enormous teeth, projects
a forked tongue; but in some the tongue is
horizontal, while in others it falls vertically; in the
first it points towards a sign which is believed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">490</a></span>
that of water, and in the others towards different
signs or emblems.... Some have pretended to see in
these dragons images of crocodiles; but nothing certain
can be known of these fantastic figures which
have no model in nature.... On the two sides still
standing there are two figures of men larger than
the natural size, seated cross-legged in the eastern
fashion, wearing necklaces of enormous pearls, rich
ornaments, and a head-dress out of all proportion,
with long flowing plumes. In one hand they hold a
kind of sceptre, and the other is placed on the breast;
a hieroglyphic of great size, placed in the middle of
each side, separates the two figures, whose heads are
turned, on the east side, one north and the other
south, while on the north side both face the west.
The frieze which surrounds this story presents a
series of small human figures, also seated in the eastern
manner, with the right hand crossed on the
breast, and the left resting on a curved sword, whose
hilt reminds us of ancient swords; a thing the more
worthy of attention since no people descended from
the Toltecs or Aztecs has made use of this kind of
arms. The head-dress of these small figures, which
closely resemble those mentioned before, is always
disproportionately large, and this circumstance, which
is found in all the Egyptian mythologic fables, is
considered in the latter an emblem of power or divinity.
With the human figures are seen various
signs, some of which seem allegorical and others
chronologic, so far as may be judged from their conformity
with those employed in the Aztec paintings....
Another sign, apparently of a different nature,
is often repeated among the figures; it is a dragon's
mouth, open and armed with teeth, as in the large
reliefs, from which projects instead of a tongue a disk
divided by a cross.... It has also been thought (Alzate)
that dances are represented on the frieze of
Xochicalco, but its perfect preservation makes such
an error inexcusable, and figures seated with legs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">491</a></span>
crossed and hands on a sword, exclude any idea of
sacred or warlike dances, and suggest only mythologic
or historical scenes. Over the frieze was a
cornice adorned with very delicate designs in the
form of <i>oalmetas</i> or meandres in the Greek style."
The cut shows one of the bas-reliefs on a larger scale
than in the preceding illustrations. There is, as
Nebel observes, a certain likeness between these
sculptured designs and the stucco reliefs of Palenque,
although in the architectural features of the monument,
and of the base on which it rests, there seems
to be no analogy whatever with any of the southern
ruins.</p>

<p>On the summit of this lower structure a few sculptured
foundation stones of a second story were found
yet in place, the walls being two feet and three inches
from the edge of the lower, except on the west, where
the space is four feet and a half. According to the
report of the inhabitants of the vicinity, the structure
had originally five receding stories, similar to the first
in outward appearance, which were all standing as late
as 1755, making the whole edifice probably about
sixty-five feet high. It is said to have terminated in
a platform, on the eastern side of which stood a large
block, forming a kind of throne, covered with hieroglyphic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">492</a></span>
sculpture. The proprietors of neighboring
sugar-works were the authors of the monument's destruction,
the stone being of a nature suitable for their
furnaces, and none other being obtainable except at a
great distance. Alzate puts on record the name of
one Estrada as the inaugurator of this disgraceful
work of devastation.<a id="FNanchor_IX-41" href="#Footnote_IX-41" class="fnanchor">[IX-41]</a> Several restorations of the
pyramid of Xochicalco have been attempted on paper,
that by the artist Nebel being probably the only one
that bears any likeness to the original; and even his
sketch, so far as the sculptured designs are concerned,
must be regarded as extremely conjectural,
having as a foundation only a few scattered blocks
and the reports of the 'oldest inhabitant.' At the
Paris international exhibition in 1867 a structure was
built and exhibited in the Champs de Mars, purporting
to be a fac-simile of this monument; but judging
from a cut published in a London paper, it might with
equal propriety have been exhibited as a model of any
other ruin in the new or old world.<a id="FNanchor_IX-42" href="#Footnote_IX-42" class="fnanchor">[IX-42]</a></p>

<p>The second story seems to have had interior apartments,
with three doorways at the head of the grand
stairway. On the summit of the lower story, according
to the <i>Revista</i>, is a pit, perhaps a covered apartment
originally, measuring twenty-two feet square,
and nearly filled with fragments of stone, some of
them sculptured, which were not removed. It is of
course possible that there exists some means of communication
between this apartment and the subterranean
galleries of the hill below.</p>

<p>East of the hill of Xochicalco, on the road to Miacatlan,
an immense stone was said to have been found
serving as a kind of cover to a hole, perhaps the entrance
to a subterranean gallery, on the face of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">493</a></span>
was sculptured an eagle tearing a prostrate native
Prometheus. It was broken up and most of the
pieces carried away, but Alzate saw one fragment containing
a part of the sculptured thigh, from which
perhaps with the aid of his imagination and his
knowledge of Grecian mythology the good padre prepared
a drawing of the whole, which he published.
Later visitors have not even seen a fragment of so
wonderful a relic. Mr Tylor speaks of a small paved
oval space somewhere in connection with the ruin, in
which he found fragments of a clay idol. There are
no springs of water on or near the hill.</p>

<p>The <i>Revista</i> says, "adjoining this hill is another
higher one, also covered with terraces of stone-work
in form of steps. A causeway of large marble flags
led to the top, where there are still some excavations
and among them a mound of large size. Nothing
further in the way of monuments is to be seen on the
lower (part of the?) hill except a granite block, which
may be the great square stone mentioned by Alzate,
which served to close the entrance to a subterranean
gallery, situated east of the principal monument."
There are also some traces of one terrace indicated on
Castañeda's view of the larger hill. On the sculptured
façades of the pyramid, all have found traces of
color in sheltered places, and have concluded that the
whole surface was originally painted red, except the
author of the account in the <i>Revista</i>, who thinks that
the groundwork of the reliefs only was covered with
a colored varnish, as was the usage in Egypt. Löwenstern
claims to have found in the vicinity of Xochicalco
the foundation of many aboriginal dwellings.</p>

<p>A slight resemblance has been noted in some of the
sculptured human figures, seated cross-legged, to the
Maya sculptures and stucco reliefs of Central America;
a few figures, like that of the rabbit, may present
some analogies to Aztec sculptures, many specimens
of which will be shown in the present chapter; the
very fact of its being a pyramid in several stories,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">494</a></span>
gives to Xochicalco a general likeness to all the more
important American ruins; the terraces on the hill-slopes
have their counterparts at Quiotepec and elsewhere;
the absence of mortar between the façade-stones
is a feature also of Mitla; still as a whole the
monument of Xochicalco stands alone; both in architecture
and sculpture it presents strong contrasts with
Copan, Uxmal, Palenque, Mitla, Cholula, Teotihuacan,
or the many pyramids of Vera Cruz. There is
no definite tradition referring the origin of this monument
to any particular pre-Aztec period, save the
universal modern tradition among the natives referring
everything wonderful to the Toltecs. It is not, moreover,
improbable that the pyramid was built by a
Nahua people during the Aztec period; for it must be
remembered first that all the grand temples in Anáhuac&mdash;the
Aztec territory proper&mdash;have disappeared
since the Conquest, so that a comparison of such
buildings with that of Xochicalco is impossible; and
second, that the Aztecs were superior to the nations
immediately surrounding them in war rather than art,
so that it would be by no means surprising to find a
grander temple in Cuernavaca than in the valley of
Mexico. The Aztec sculpture on such monuments as
have been found in the city of Mexico if different
from, is not inferior to that at Xochicalco, and there
is no reason whatever to doubt the ability of the Aztecs
to build such a pyramid. Still there remains of
course the possibility of a pre-Aztec antiquity for the
building on the hill of flowers, and of Maya influence
exerted upon its builders.<a id="FNanchor_IX-43" href="#Footnote_IX-43" class="fnanchor">[IX-43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the south-eastern part of the state from Yahualica
northward to Mecamecan, relics have been discovered,
mostly by Dupaix, in several localities. At
Yahualica, near Huautla, there are tombs, with stone
images, human remains, pottery, and metates, also
some metallic relics not described.<a id="FNanchor_IX-44" href="#Footnote_IX-44" class="fnanchor">[IX-44]</a> At Xonacatepec
was seen a mask of about the natural size, carved
very neatly from a whitish translucent stone.<a id="FNanchor_IX-45" href="#Footnote_IX-45" class="fnanchor">[IX-45]</a> At
the sugar plantation of Casasano, in the same region,
a somewhat remarkable relic was a stone chest, of
rectangular base, larger at the bottom than at the
top, with a cover fitting like that of a modern chest.
It was cut from a grayish stone, and when found by
laborers engaged in digging a ditch, is said to have
been filled with stone ornaments. At the same place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">496</a></span>
was seen a circular stone, three feet in diameter and
nine inches thick, sculptured in geometric figures on
one side, as shown in the preceding cut.<a id="FNanchor_IX-46" href="#Footnote_IX-46" class="fnanchor">[IX-46]</a></p>

<p>Another similar stone of the same thickness, and
about three feet and a half in diameter, was built
into a modern wall at Ozumba. These geometrically
carved circular blocks are of not infrequent occurrence
on the Mexican plateaux; of their use nothing is
known, but they seem to bear a vague resemblance
to the Aztec calendar and sacrificial stones to be
described later. Another class of circular blocks,
from two to three feet in diameter, with curves and
various ornamental figures sculptured on one face, are
also of frequent occurrence. Several of this class will
be mentioned and illustrated in connection with the
relics of Xochimilco. Two of them were seen by
Dupaix at Chimalhuacan Tlachialco, near Ozumba,
together with two small idols of stone. At Ahuehuepa,
in the same region, was a statue which had
lost the head and the legs below the knees; a hieroglyphic
device is seen on the breast, and a small
cord passes round the waist, and is tied in a bow-knot
in front. Two fragments of head-dresses carved
in red stone were found at the same place. A few
miles east of the village of Mecamecan is an isolated
rock of gray granite, artificially formed into pyramidal
shape as shown in the cut. It is about twelve
feet high and fifty-five feet in circumference, having
rudely cut steps, which lead up the eastern slope.
Dupaix conjectures that this monument was intended
for some astronomic use, and that the man sculptured
on the side is engaged in making astronomical observations,
the results of which are expressed by the
other figures on the rock. The only possible foundation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>
for the opinion is the resemblance of some of the
signs to those by which the Aztecs expressed dates.<a id="FNanchor_IX-47" href="#Footnote_IX-47" class="fnanchor">[IX-47]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Entering now the valley of Mexico, we find many
localities on the banks, and islands of Lake Chalco
where relics of the ancient inhabitants have been
brought to light. At Xochimilco on the western
shore of the lake, Dupaix mentions the following:&mdash;1st.
A stone block with regular sides, on one of
which about three feet square are sculptured two concentric
circles, as large as the space permits, with
smaller circles outside of the larger, at each corner of
the block. 2d. A crouching monster of stone thirty
inches high, which apparently served originally for
a fountain or aqueduct, the water flowing through the
mouth. 3d. A semi-spherical pedestal of limestone,
broken in two pieces, three feet high, and decorated
on the curved surface with oval figures radiating from
the centre. 4th. A lizard thirty inches long, sculptured
on a block which is built into a modern wall.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">498</a></span>
5th. A coat of arms, also on a block in a wall, consisting
of a circle on parallel lances like some already
described. Within the circle is a very perfect Maltese
cross, hanging from the lower part is a fan-like
plume, and elsewhere on the smooth faces of the stone
are nine very peculiar knots or tassels. 6th. A kind
of flat-fish three feet eight inches long, carved from a
bluish gray stone. 7th. A coiled serpent in red porphyry,
a foot and a half in diameter, and nine feet
long if uncoiled. This relic is shown in the cut.
8th. Two death's heads in stone. 9th. A rabbit in
low relief on a fragment of stone. 10th. An animal
in red stone on a cubic pedestal of the same material.
11th. A stone image of a seated female. 12th.
An idol with a man's head and woman's breasts. 13th.
Ten sculptured blocks, the faces of which are shown
in the following cut, and which would seem to have
served only for decorative purposes. Most of them
have rough backs, evidently having been taken from
ancient walls; and many of these and other similar
blocks found in this region had tenons like that shown
in fig. 9 of the cut. Fig. 7 shows one of the several
death's heads found at Xochimilco.</p>

</div>

<p>At Tlahuac, or Cuitlahuac, were seen two circular
stones something over three feet in diameter and half
as thick, of black porous volcanic material. Each had
a circular hole in the centre, rude incised figures on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>
the faces, and a tenon at one point of the circumference.
They strongly remind me of the rings in the
walls of the so-called gymnasium at Chichen in Yucatan.
Another relic was a cylindrical stone of a hard
gray material, of the same dimensions as the preceding,
but without a supporting tenon. The circular
faces were plain, but the sides, or rim, were decorated
with circles, bands, and points symmetrically arranged
and sculptured in low relief. And finally there was
found at Tlahuac the very beautiful vase of hard iron-gray
stone shown in the cut. It is eight feet four
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">500</a></span>
inches in circumference on the outside, one foot nine
inches in diameter on the inside, and elaborately
sculptured in low relief on both the exterior and interior
surface. In Kingsborough's edition of Dupaix's work
it is stated that the two causeways which led to the
town across the waters of Lake Chalco are still in good
preservation, five or six yards wide and of varying
height, according to the depth of the water. In the
report of the Ministro de Fomento in 1854 there is
also a mention of a dike built to keep the waters of
the lake from Mexico. Another dike, serving also as
a causeway at Tulyahualco is mentioned in the same
report.</p>

<p>At Xico, on an island in Lake Chalco, there are
some traces of an aboriginal city, in the shape of
foundation walls of masonry, stone terraces, and what
is very important if authentic, well-burned bricks of
different forms and dimensions. In the Mexican
government report referred to, the foundations of a
palace are alluded to.</p>

<p>At Misquique, on another of the lake islands Dupaix
found the following objects left by the antiguos:&mdash;1st.
A sculptured monster's head, with a tenon for
insertion in a wall. 2d. A large granite vase, circular
in form, four feet and a half in diameter, three
feet and a half high, sculptured on the upper rim,
painted on the inside, and polished on the outer surface.
It rests on a cylindrical base, smaller than the
vase itself, and is used in modern times as a baptismal
font. 3d. A mill-stone shaped block, with a
tenon, very similar to those found at Tlahuac, except
that the sculptures on the face are evidently in low
relief in this case. 4th. An animal called by Dupaix
a coyote, sculptured on the face of a block. 5th.
A cylindrical stone twenty-one inches in diameter
and twenty-eight in height, round the circumference
of which is sculptured, or apparently merely incised,
a serpent. 6th. A square block with concentric circles
and other figures, similar to those at Xochimilco.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>
7th. Another block with a spiral figure. 8th. A
very finely formed head of gray veined stone, furnished
with a tenon at the back of the neck. 9th.
Three small and rudely formed images, one of green
jasper and two of a red stone.</p>

the ornamental blocks, one bearing clearly defined

the annals of Toltec times. Veytia tells us that in
his time some vestiges of the ancient capital were
still visible; and Gondra describes a clay idol found
at Culhuacan, and shown in the cut, as an image of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>
Quetzalcoatl, giving, however, no very clear reasons
for his belief. This relic is fourteen inches high,
thirteen inches wide, and is preserved in the Mexican
Museum.<a id="FNanchor_IX-48" href="#Footnote_IX-48" class="fnanchor">[IX-48]</a></p>

<p>The relics discovered in Anáhuac at points westward
from the lakes, I shall describe without specifying
in my text the exact locality of each place
referred to. At Chapultepec there is a tradition
that statues representing Montezuma and Axayacatl
were carved in the living rock of the cliff; and these
rock portraits are said to have remained many years
after the Conquest, having been seen by the distinguished
Mexican scientist Leon y Gama. Brasseur
de Bourbourg even claims to have seen traces of
them, but this may perhaps be doubted. One was
destroyed at the beginning of the eighteenth century
by order of the over-religious authorities; but the
other remained in perfect preservation until the year
1753, when it also fell a victim to anti-pagan barbarism.
The immense cypresses or <i>ahuehuetes</i> that still
stand at the foot of Chapultepec, 'hill of the grasshopper,'
are said to have been large and flourishing
trees before the coming of the Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_IX-49" href="#Footnote_IX-49" class="fnanchor">[IX-49]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HILL OF OTONCAPOLCO.</p>

<p>A few miles from the celebrated church of Nuestra
Señora de los Remedios, is a terraced stone-faced hill,
similar perhaps in its original condition to Xochicalco,
except that the terraces are more numerous and only
three or four feet high. Although, only a short distance
from the capital in an easily accessible locality,
only two writers have mentioned its existence&mdash;Alzate
y Ramirez in 1792 and Löwenstern in 1838.
The former calls the hill Otoncapolco, and his article
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">503</a></span>
in the <i>Gaceta de Literatura</i> is mainly devoted to proving
that this was the point where Cortés fortified himself
after the '<span xml:lang="es">noche triste</span>,' instead of the hill on
which the church of Remedios stands, as others in
Alzate's time believed. The author, who visited the
place with an artist, says, "I saw ruins, and hewn
stones of great magnitude, all of which proves to the
eye that this was a fortification, or as the historians
say, a temple, because they thought that everything
made by the Indians had some connection with idolatry;
it is sure that in the place where the celebrated
sanctuary stands, there is not found the slightest vestige
of fortress or temple, while on the contrary, all
this is observed at Otoncapolco." This with the remark
that this monument, although not comparable
to Xochicalco, yet merits examination, is all the information
Padre Alzate gives us; and Löwenstern
adds but little to our knowledge of the monument.
He found débris of sculptured stone, obsidian, vases,
and pottery; also the ruins of a castle two-thirds up
the slope, in connection with which was found a flat
stone over six feet long, bearing a sculptured five-branched
cross&mdash;a kind of coat of arms. The hill is
from two hundred and sixty to three hundred and
twenty-five feet high, has a square summit platform,
and the whole surface of its slopes was covered with
stone-work, now much displaced, in the shape of steps,
or terraces, between three and four feet high. At one
point the explorer found, as he believed, the entrance
to a subterranean passage, into which he did not enter
but inserted a pole about nine feet.<a id="FNanchor_IX-50" href="#Footnote_IX-50" class="fnanchor">[IX-50]</a></p>

<p>At Tacuba, the ancient Tlacopan, Bradford mentions
the "ruins of an ancient pyramid, constructed
with layers of unburnt brick," and Löwenstern speaks
of broken pottery and fragments of obsidian. The
latter author also claims to have seen near the church
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>
of Guadalupe the foundations of many small dwellings
which constituted an aboriginal city.<a id="FNanchor_IX-51" href="#Footnote_IX-51" class="fnanchor">[IX-51]</a> At Malinalco,
near Toluca, two musical instruments, <i>tlamalhuilili</i>,
are mentioned. They were carved from hard
wood and had skin stretched across one end, being
three feet long and eighteen inches in diameter.<a id="FNanchor_IX-52" href="#Footnote_IX-52" class="fnanchor">[IX-52]</a>
Mr Foster gives a cut of a tripod vase in the Chicago
Academy of Sciences, which was dug up near San
José. "It is very symmetrically moulded, and is ornamented
by a series of <i>chevrons</i> or small triangles.
This chevron mode of ornamentation appears to have
been widely prevalent."<a id="FNanchor_IX-53" href="#Footnote_IX-53" class="fnanchor">[IX-53]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CITY OF MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2">In describing the relics which have been discovered
from time to time in the city of Mexico, the ancient
Aztec capital, I shall make no mention for the present
of such objects, preserved in public and private
antiquarian collections in that city, as have been
brought from other parts of the state or republic.
When the locality is known where any one of this
class of relics was found I shall describe it when treating
of antiquities in that locality. The many relics
whose origin is unknown will be alluded to at the end
of this chapter. Since all who have visited Mexico
or written books about that country, almost without
exception, have had something to say of antiquities
and of the collections in the National Museum, as
well as of the relics belonging strictly to the city, I
shall economize space and avoid a useless repetition
by deferring a list of such authorities to my account
of the miscellaneous relics of the Mexican Republic
at the end of the chapter, referring for my present
purpose only to the more important authorities, or
such as contain original information or illustrations.</p>

<p>No architectural monuments whatever remain within
the city limits. The grand palaces of the Aztec
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">505</a></span>
monarchs, the palatial residences of the nobility, the
abodes of wealth and fashion, like the humbler dwellings
of the masses, have utterly disappeared; monuments
reared in honor of the gods have not outlasted
the structures devoted to trade; the lofty teocalli of
the blood-thirsty Huitzilopochtli, like the shrines of
lesser and gentler deities, has left no trace.</p>

<p>Movable relics in the shape of idols and sculptured
stones are not numerous, although some of them are
very important. No systematic search for such monuments
has ever been made, and those that have been
brought to light were accidentally discovered. Some
sculptured blocks of the greatest antiquarian value
have been actually seen in making excavations for
modern improvements, and have been allowed to remain
undisturbed under the pavements and public
squares of a great city! There can be no doubt that
thousands of interesting monuments are buried beneath
the town. The treasures of the Plaza Mayor
will perhaps be some day brought out of their retirement
to tell their story of aboriginal times, but hundreds
of Aztec divinities in stone will sleep on till
doomsday. It is unfortunate that these gods of other
days cannot regain for a time the power they used to
wield, turn at least once in their graves, and shake
the drowsy populace above into a realization of the
fact that they live in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The three principal monuments of Mexico Tenochtitlan
are the Calendar-Stone, the so-called Sacrificial
Stone, and the idol called Teoyaomiqui. They were
all dug up in the Plaza Mayor where the great teocalli
is supposed to have stood, and where they were
doubtless thrown down and buried from the sight of
the natives at the time of the Conquest. In the
years 1790 to 1792 the plaza was leveled and paved
by order of the government, and in the excavations
for this purpose and for drainage the three monuments
were discovered, the Calendar-Stone and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>
idol very near the surface, and the third relic at a
depth of twenty-five or thirty feet.</p>

<p>The Calendar-Stone was a rectangular parallelopipedon
of porphyry, thirteen feet one inch and a half
square, three feet three inches and a half thick, and
weighing in its present mutilated state twenty-four
tons. The sculptured portion on one side is enclosed
in a circle eleven feet one and four-fifths inches in
diameter. These are the dimensions given by Humboldt,
who personally examined the stone, and agree
almost exactly with those given by Leon y Gama,
who examined and made drawings of the monument
immediately after its discovery. Gama pronounced
the material to be limestone, which provoked a sharp
controversy between him and Padre Alzate, the latter
calling the material, which he tested by means of
acids, a volcanic rock. Humboldt's opinion is of
course decisive in such a matter. The centre of the
circle does not exactly correspond with that of the
square, and Gama concludes from this circumstance
that the stone had a companion block which might be
found near the place where this was found.<a id="FNanchor_IX-54" href="#Footnote_IX-54" class="fnanchor">[IX-54]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">507</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CALENDAR-STONE.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i507"></a>
<img src="images/i507.jpg" width="535" height="542" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Aztec Calendar-Stone.</p>
</div>

<p>The stone has been for many years built into the
wall of the cathedral at the base, where it is exposed
to the view of all passers-by, and to the action of the
elements. While lying uncovered in the plaza it was
considerably mutilated by the natives, who took
the opportunity of manifesting their horror of the
ancient gods, by pelting with stones this relic of
their paganism. Parts of the stone were also broken
off when it was thrown down and buried by the conquistadores.
Fortunately the sculptured portions
have been but slightly injured, and are shown in
the cut. The plates published by Gama, Humboldt,
Nebel, Mayer, and others, are all tolerably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">508</a></span>
accurate; except that they were drawn to represent
the stone correctly on the plate or block, and
of course reversed in printing. The origin of this
error is probably to be found in the fact that
nearly all have copied Gama's plate. In my cut the
error is corrected and the sculptured figures agree
exactly with Charnay's photograph.<a id="FNanchor_IX-55" href="#Footnote_IX-55" class="fnanchor">[IX-55]</a> These figures
are the symbols of the Aztec calendar, many of
which are well understood, while others are of unknown
or disputed signification. The calendar has
been sufficiently explained in a preceding volume,
and I shall not enter upon its elucidation here. The
sculpture is in low relief, very accurately worked, and
the circle which encloses it projects, according to
Mayer, seven inches and a half, according to Gama
and Nebel about three inches, and the rim of the
circle is also adorned with sculptures not shown in
the cut. Respecting the excellence of the sculpture
Humboldt says: "the concentric circles, the divisions,
and the subdivisions without number are traced with
mathematical exactitude; the more we examine the
details of this sculpture, the more we discover this
taste for repetitions of the same forms, this spirit of
order, this sentiment of symmetry, which, among half-civilized
peoples, take the place of the sentiment of
the beautiful."</p>

<p>No stone like that from which the Calendar-Stone
is hewn, is found within a radius of twenty-five or
thirty miles of Mexico, and this may be regarded as
the largest block which the natives are known to
have moved over a long distance. Prescott tells us
that the stone was brought from the mountains beyond
Lake Chalco, and was dropped into the water
while being transported across one of the causeways.
There is no reason to attribute this monument to
any nation preceding the Aztecs, although the calendar
itself was the invention of an older people.
Wax models of this and other relics, described by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">509</a></span>
Mr Tylor as very inaccurate, are sold in Mexico; and
a plaster cast, taken by Mr Bullock in 1823, was
exhibited in London.<a id="FNanchor_IX-56" href="#Footnote_IX-56" class="fnanchor">[IX-56]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Sacrificial Stone&mdash;Mexico.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">THE SACRIFICIAL STONE.</p>

<p>The Sacrificial Stone, so called, is a cylindrical
block of porphyry, nine feet and ten inches in diameter,
three feet seven and one fourth inches thick.
This also was dug from the Plaza Mayor, was carried
to the courtyard of the University, where it has lain
ever since, much of the time half covered in the
ground, and where different visitors have examined
it. The cut, which I have copied from Col. Mayer's
drawing, shows the sculpture which covers one side
of the stone, the other side being plain. The name
of Sacrificial Stone, by which it is generally known,
probably originated from the canal which leads from
the centre to the edge, and which was imagined to
have carried off the blood of sacrifices; but the reader
will notice at once that this stone bears not the
slightest resemblance to the altars on which the
priests cut out the hearts of their human victims, as
described in a preceding volume. Some authors,
among whom is Humboldt, believe this to be the
<i>temalacatl</i>, or gladiatorial stone, on which captives
were doomed to fight against great odds until overcome
and put to death. The bas-relief sculptures,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">510</a></span>
the central concavity, the canal, and the absence of
any means of securing the foot of the captive, are
very strong arguments against this use of the cylinder.
A smooth surface would certainly be desirable
for so desperate a conflict, and the sculptured figures
on the rim, or circumference, soon to be noticed, show
that the plain side of the stone was not in its original
position uppermost. Gama, the first to write about
the monument, pointed out very clearly the objections
to the prevailing ideas of its aboriginal purpose.
He claimed that the stone was, like the one already
described, a calendar-stone, on which was inscribed
the system of feast-days. The strongest objection to
this theory was the existence of the central concavity
and canal, which, however, Gama considers not to
have belonged to the monument at all, but to have
been added by the ruder hands of those who wished
to blot out the face of the sun which originally occupied
the centre. Latrobe also says, "I have but
little hesitation in asserting that the groove in the
upper surface formed no part of the original design;"
but Col. Mayer, who has carefully examined this
relic, tells me that the canal presents no signs whatever
of being more recent than the other carving,
and it must be admitted that the Spaniards would
hardly have adopted this method of mutilation.
Tylor suggests that this was a sacrificial altar, but
used for offerings of animals. Fossey speaks of it
as a 'triumphal stone.' But in alluding to these
theories I am departing somewhat from my purpose,
which is to give all the information extant respecting
each relic as it exists.</p>

<img src="images/i511.jpg" width="485" height="405" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Sculpture on the Sacrificial Stone.</p>
</div>

<p>The whole circumference of the stone is covered
with sculptured figures, consisting of fifteen groups.
Each group contains two human figures, apparently
warriors or kings, victor and vanquished, differing
but little in position or insignia in the different
groups, but accompanied by hieroglyphic signs, which
may express their names or those of their nations.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">511</a></span>
Two groups as sketched by Nebel are shown in the
cut. According to Gama these sculptured figures
represent by the thirty dancers the festivities celebrated
twice each year on the occasion of the sun
passing the zenith; and also commemorate, since the
festivals were in honor of the Sun and of Huitzilopochtli,
the battles and victories of the Aztecs, the
hieroglyphics being the names of conquered provinces,
and most of them legible.<a id="FNanchor_IX-57" href="#Footnote_IX-57" class="fnanchor">[IX-57]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">512</a></span></p>

<p>The idol of which the cut on the opposite page
shows the front, was the first to be brought to light
in grading the Plaza Mayor in August, 1790. It is
an immense block of bluish-gray porphyry, about ten
feet high and six feet wide and thick, sculptured on
front, rear, top, and bottom, into a most complicated
and horrible combination of human, animal, and ideal
forms. No verbal description could give the reader
any clearer idea of the details of this idol than he
can gain from the cuts which I present, following
Nebel for the front, and Gama for the other views.
Gama first expressed the opinion, in which other
authors coincide, that the front shown in the opposite
cut represents the Aztec goddess of death, Teoyaomiqui,
whose duty it was to bear the souls of dead
warriors to the House of the Sun&mdash;the Mexican
Elysion.<a id="FNanchor_IX-58" href="#Footnote_IX-58" class="fnanchor">[IX-58]</a></p>

<p>The following cut is a rear view of the idol, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">514</a></span>
represents, according to Gama, Huitzilopochtli, god of
war and husband of the divinity of gentler sex, whose
emblems are carved on the front.<a id="FNanchor_IX-59" href="#Footnote_IX-59" class="fnanchor">[IX-59]</a> The bottom of
this monument bears the sculptured design shown in
the following cut, which is thought to represent
Mictlantecutli, god of the infernal regions, the last of
this cheerful trinity, goddess of death, god of war,
and god of hell, three distinct deities united in one
idol, according to the Aztec catechism. The sculptured
base, together with the side projections, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
of the cut showing the front, prove pretty conclusively
that this idol in the days when it received
the worship and sacrifices of a mighty people, was
raised from the ground or floor, and was supported
by two pillars at the sides; or possibly by the walls
of some sacred enclosure, the space left under the
idol being the entrance. The next cut shows a profile
view of the idol, and also a representation of the
top. This idol also was removed to the University,
and until 1821 was kept buried in the courtyard,
that it might not kindle anew the aboriginal superstitions.<a id="FNanchor_IX-60" href="#Footnote_IX-60" class="fnanchor">[IX-60]</a></p>

<p>A monument similar in form and dimensions to
the Sacrificial Stone, was found in the Plaza Mayor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">516</a></span>
during certain repairs that were being made, and
although it was again covered up and allowed to
remain, Sr Gondra made a drawing of the upper
sculptured surface, which was published by Col.
Mayer, and is copied in the cut. The surface presented
the peculiarity of being painted in bright
colors, yellow, red, green, crimson, and black, still
quite vivid at the time of its discovery. Sr Gondra
believed this to be the true gladiatorial stone, but
the sculptured surface would hardly agree with this
theory. Mayer notes as a peculiarity "the open
hand which is sculptured on a shield and between the
legs of some of the figures of the groups at the
sides" not shown in the cut. Gama also speaks of a
painted stone found in June, 1792, in the cemetery
of the Cathedral, which was left in the ground, and
which he says evidently formed the entrance to the
temple of Quetzalcoatl.<a id="FNanchor_IX-61" href="#Footnote_IX-61" class="fnanchor">[IX-61]</a></p>

<p>Another relic found during the excavations in January,
1791, was a kind of tomb, six feet and a half
long and three feet and a quarter wide, built of slabs
of <i>tetzontli</i>, a porous stone much used for building-purposes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">517</a></span>
in Mexico, filled with sand, which covered
the skeleton of some animal like a coyote, together
with clay vases and bells of cast bronze. It was
perhaps the grave of some sacred animal. Gama
also mentions an image of the water god <i>Tlaloc</i>, of
a common black stone, three feet long and one foot
wide; he also vaguely speaks of several other relics
not particularly described, and even found some remains
in digging the foundations of his own house.<a id="FNanchor_IX-62" href="#Footnote_IX-62" class="fnanchor">[IX-62]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Burial Vase&mdash;Tlatelulco.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TLATELULCAN VASE.</p>

<p>The plaza of Tlatelulco is nearly as prolific in
ancient monuments as the Plaza Mayor. Here was
found the beautiful earthen burial vase shown in the
cut. It is twenty-two inches high, fifteen inches and
a half in diameter, covered with a circular lid, also
shown in the cut, and when found was full of human
skulls. The beauty of this vase can only be fully
appreciated by a glance at the original, or at the
sketch in Col. Mayer's album made by himself from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">518</a></span>
the original in the Museum at Mexico, and showing
the brilliant colors, blue, red, and yellow, with which
it is adorned. The author says, "in many respects, it
struck me as belonging to a higher grade of art than
anything in the Museum, except, perhaps, the obsidian
carvings, and one or two of the vases." Gondra
mentions another burial casket, carved from
basalt and of rectangular form.<a id="FNanchor_IX-63" href="#Footnote_IX-63" class="fnanchor">[IX-63]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Head of Goddess Centeotl.</p>
</div>

<p>The head shown in the cut, taken from the <i>Mosaico
Mexicano</i>, measures twenty-nine by thirty-six
inches, and is carved from a block of serpentine, a
stone rarely found in Mexico. It was dug up near
the convent of Santa Teresa in 1830, and has been
supposed to represent the Aztec Goddess Centeotl.
The bottom being covered with sculpture, it seems
that the monument is complete in its present state.
Another serpentine image of somewhat peculiar form,
is shown in an original sketch in the Album of Col.
Mayer, who says, "it appears to have been a charm or
talisman, and in many respects resembles the bronze
figures which were found at Pompeii, and are preserved
in the Secret Museum at Naples." It was found at
Tlatelulco, and is preserved in the Mexican Museum.<a id="FNanchor_IX-64" href="#Footnote_IX-64" class="fnanchor">[IX-64]</a>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS RELICS.</p>

<p>Mr Bullock speaks of several relics not mentioned
by any other visitor:&mdash;"In the cloisters behind the
Dominican convent is a noble specimen of the great
serpent-idol, almost perfect, and of fine workmanship.
This monstrous divinity is represented in the act of
swallowing a human victim, which is seen crushed and
struggling in its horrid jaws." The corner-stone of
the Lottery Office he described as "the head of the
serpent-idol," not less than seventy feet long, when
entire. Under the gateway of a house opposite the
mint was a fine life-size recumbent statue found in
digging a well. A house on a street corner on the
south-east side of the plaza rested on an altar of black
basalt, ornamented with the tail and claws of a reptile.<a id="FNanchor_IX-64b" href="#Footnote_IX-64b" class="fnanchor">[IX-64]</a>
Mayer dug up in the courtyard of the University
two feathered serpents, of which he gives cuts, as
well as of several other relics found within the city
limits, including the '<span xml:lang="es">perro mudo</span>,' a stone image of
one of the dumb dogs bred by the Aztecs, and a
seated human figure known as the '<span xml:lang="es">indio triste</span>.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-65" href="#Footnote_IX-65" class="fnanchor">[IX-65]</a></p>

of bronze hatchets, dug up in the city of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_IX-66" href="#Footnote_IX-66" class="fnanchor">[IX-66]</a>
Sr Gondra gives plates of nine Mexican musical instruments,
one of which of very peculiar construction
was found in the city, and is shown in the preceding cut.
The top shaped like a coiled serpent is of burned clay,
resting on the image of a tortoise carved from wood,
and that on a base of tortoise-shell. The whole is
about twelve inches high.<a id="FNanchor_IX-67" href="#Footnote_IX-67" class="fnanchor">[IX-67]</a> And finally I give a cut
which represents part of a block built into the wall

<p class="sidenote">RUINS OF TEZCUCO.</p>

<p>Tezcuco, the ancient rival of Mexico, across the
lake eastward, formerly on the lake shore, but now by
the retirement of the water left some miles inland,
has, notwithstanding her ancient rank in all that pertained
to art, left no monuments to compare with
those taken from the Plaza Mayor of Mexico. But
unlike the latter city Tezcuco yet presents traces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">521</a></span>
traces only, of her aboriginal architectural structures.
Fragments of building-material are found wherever
excavations are made, and the material of the old city
is said to have been extensively used in the construction
of the modern, so that plain or sculptured stone
blocks, shaped by the aborigines, are often seen in modern
walls in different parts of the town. In the southern
part of the city are the foundations of several large
pyramids, apparently built of adobes, burnt bricks, and
cement, since the materials named all occur among the
débris. The foundations show the structures to have
been originally about four hundred feet square, but of
course supply no further information respecting their
form. These pyramids were three in number at the
time of Mayer's visit, standing in a line from north
to south, and strewn with fragments of pottery, idols,
and obsidian knives. Tylor found traces, barely visible,
of two large teocallis; he also speaks vaguely of
some burial mounds, and states that there is a Mexican
calendar-stone built into the wall of one of the
churches. In the north-west part of the town Mayer
found another shapeless heap of bricks, adobes, and
pottery, overgrown with magueys. On the top were
several large basaltic slabs, squared and lying north
and south. The rectangular stone basin with sculptured
sides shown in the cut, was found in connection
with this heap and preserved in the Peñasco collection
in Mexico. Also in this heap of débris, according
to Mayer, Mr Poinsett found in 1825 an arched
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">522</a></span>
sewer or aqueduct built of small stone blocks laid in
mortar, together with a 'flat arch' of very large
blocks over a doorway. I find no mention of these
remains in Mr Poinsett's book. Bradford states
that, "lying neglected under a gateway, an idol has
been observed nearly perfect, and representing a rattlesnake,"
painted in bright colors. Mr Latrobe
found a stone idol, perhaps the same, in 1834, and
Nebel gives a sketch of a most interesting relic, said
to have come from Tezcuco, and shown in the cut. It
was the custom of the Aztec priests at certain times
to wear the skin of sacrificed victims.<a id="FNanchor_IX-69" href="#Footnote_IX-69" class="fnanchor">[IX-69]</a> This figure
seems to represent a priest thus clad. It is carved
from basalt, and was half the natural size, the natural
skin being painted a bright red, and the outer one a
dirty white. A collection of Tezcucan relics seen by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">523</a></span>
Tylor in 1856, contained, 1st. A nude female figure
four or five feet high, well formed from a block of
alabaster. 2d. A man in hard stone, wearing a mask
which represents a jackals head. 3d. A beautiful
alabaster box containing spherical beads of green jade,
as large as pigeons' eggs and brilliantly polished.<a id="FNanchor_IX-70" href="#Footnote_IX-70" class="fnanchor">[IX-70]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">HILL OF TEZCOCINGO.</p>

<p class="p2">About three miles eastward from Tezcuco is the
isolated rocky hill known as Tezcocingo, which rises
with steep slopes in conical form to the height of
perhaps six hundred feet above the plain. A portion
of one side of the hill, beginning at a point probably
on the south-eastern slope, is graded very much as if
intended for a modern railroad, forming a level terrace
round a part of the circumference. From the termination
of the grading, an embankment with level
summit, variously estimated at from sixty to two
hundred feet high, connects this hill with another
three quarters of a mile distant, the side of which is
likewise graded into a terrace thirty feet wide and a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">524</a></span>
mile and a half long, extending two thirds round
the circumference; and then another embankment
stretches away towards the mountains ten or fifteen
miles distant, although no one seems to have recorded
any attempt to explore its whole extent. The
object of both grading and embankments was to
support an aqueduct or pipe ten inches in diameter,
which is still in very good preservation at several
points. Waddy Thompson brought away a piece of
the water-pipe as a relic, and he pronounces the
material to be a very hard plaster made of lime and
small portions of a soft red stone. "It is about two
feet wide, and has a trough in the centre about ten
inches wide. This trough is covered with a convex
piece of the same plaster, which being placed upon
it when the plaster was soft, seems to be all one
piece, making together a tube of ten inches in diameter,
through which the water flowed from the distant
mountains to the basin, which it enters through a
round hole about the size of one made with a two-inch
auger. No plasterer of the present day can construct
a more beautiful piece of work; it is in its
whole extent as smooth as the plastering on a well-finished
wall, and is as hard as stone." Mayer tells
us that the aqueduct was made of baked clay, the
pipes being as perfect as when they were first laid.
He also seems to imply that along the graded terraces
the water was conducted in a ditch, or canal,
instead of the regular pipes. But Tylor, on the
other hand, says "the channel of the aqueduct was
made principally of blocks of the same material
[porphyry], on which the smooth stucco that had
once covered the whole, inside and out, still remained
very perfect."</p>

<p class="caption">Montezuma's Bath.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">MONTEZUMA'S BATH.</p>

<p>At the termination of the aqueduct on the eastern
slope of Tezcocingo, on the brink of a precipitous
descent of two hundred feet to the plain, is the work
shown in the cut, from Mayer, hewn from the living
rock of reddish porphyry, and popularly known as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">525</a></span>
Montezuma's Bath. There was of course no reason
whatever to attach this name to it, for although it is
possible, if not probable, that it may have been used
for a bath, it is very certain that it never belonged
to Montezuma, but rather to Nezahualcoyotl or some
other of the Tezcucan kings.<a id="FNanchor_IX-71" href="#Footnote_IX-71" class="fnanchor">[IX-71]</a> The circular basin in
the centre is four feet and a half in diameter, and
three feet deep, and the circular aperture through
which it received water from the aqueduct, is shown
in the cut, together with what seem to be seats cut
in the rock. Respecting this monument Col. Mayer
says: "Its true use, however, is perfectly evident to
those who are less fanciful or antiquarian than the
generality of visiters. The picturesque view from this
spot, over a small plain set in a frame of the surrounding
mountains and glens which border the eastern
side of Tescocingo, undoubtedly made this recess
a favorite resort for the royal personages at whose
expense these costly works were made. From the
surrounding seats, they enjoyed a delicious prospect
over the lovely but secluded scenery, while, in the
basin, at their feet, were gathered the waters of a
neighboring spring, [implying that the basin and
aqueduct were not connected] which, whilst refreshing
them after their promenade on the mountain,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526">526</a></span>
gurgled out of its stony channel and fell in a mimic
cascade over the precipitous cliff that terminated
their path. It was to this shady spot that they no
doubt retired in the afternoon, when the sun was
hot on the west of the mountain, and here the sovereign
and his court, in all probability, enjoyed the
repose and privacy which were denied them amid
the bustle of the city."</p>

<p>Accounts of the other remains at Tezcocingo are
somewhat confused. On the northern slope is another
recess, bordered by seats cut in the living rock, and
leading to a perpendicular cliff on which a calendar is
said to have been carved, but destroyed by the natives
in later days. Traces of a spiral road winding up to
the summit were found by Mayer. Tylor reports a
terrace round the hill near the top, some sculptured
blocks on the summit, and a second circular bath.
Bullock speaks of "ruins of a very large building&mdash;the
cemented stones remaining in some places covered
with stucco, and forming walks and terraces, but much
encumbered with earth fallen from above.... As we
descended our guide showed us in the rock a large
reservoir for supplying with water the palace, whose
walls still remained eight feet high; and as we examined
farther, we found that the whole mountain had
been covered with palaces, temples, baths and hanging
gardens." Beaufoy saw a mass of porphyry on the
summit, which had been fashioned artificially and furnished
with steps. The whole surface, overgrown
with nopal-bushes, abounds in fragments of pottery,
obsidian, cement, and stone.<a id="FNanchor_IX-72" href="#Footnote_IX-72" class="fnanchor">[IX-72]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">527</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">BOSQUE DEL CONTADOR.</p>

<p>North-westward from Tezcuco on the level plain is
the Bosque del Contador, a grove of <i>ahuehuetes</i>, or
cypresses, arranged in a double row and enclosing a
square area of about ten acres, whose sides face the
cardinal points. The trees are between five and six
hundred in number, some of them forty to fifty feet
in circumference, and are supposed to date from a
time preceding the conquest. The ground on which
they stand is firm and somewhat raised above the
level of the surrounding plain, which itself is but
little above the waters of the lake. The enclosed
area, however, is soft, miry, and impassable. It is
uncertain whether this area was originally an inland
lake surrounded by trees, or an island grove in the
waters of the lake. From the north-west corner of
the square a double row of similar trees extends some
distance westward, and near its termination is a dyke
and a walled tank full of water; at the north-east corner,
a rectangular mass of porphyry is said to project
above the surface and to be surrounded by a ditch;
and from this point some traces of a causeway may be
seen extending towards the east. Small stone idols,
articles of pottery, and various small relics have been
dug up in and about this grove, which was not improbably
a favorite promenade of the Chichimec, or
Acolhuan monarchs.<a id="FNanchor_IX-73" href="#Footnote_IX-73" class="fnanchor">[IX-73]</a></p>

<p>On the hacienda of Chapingo, about a league south
of Tezcuco, an ancient causeway was found in excavating,
at a depth of four feet below the surface, the
cedar piles of which were in a good state of preservation.
Under the causeway was the skeleton of a
mastodon, and similar skeletons are said to have been
found at other points in the valley of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_IX-74" href="#Footnote_IX-74" class="fnanchor">[IX-74]</a>

<p class="caption">Bridge at Huejutla.</p>
</div>

<p>At Huejutla, also in the vicinity of Tezcuco, a
wall was still standing as late as 1834, which was
nearly thirty feet high, between five and six feet
thick, and built of stone and mortar. From bottom
to top the wall was divided into five distinct divisions
distinguished by the arrangement of the stones. The
widest of these divisions was built of cylindrical and
oval stones, the rounded ends of which projected
symmetrically. The wall terminates on the east at
a ravine, which is crossed by a bridge of a single
span, twenty feet long and forty feet high. The
span is an arch of peculiar construction, being formed
of stone slabs, set on edge, and the interstices filled
with mortar. The irregularities of the stones and
the firmness of the mortar support the structure,
forming a near approach to the regular arch as shown
in the cut from Tylor. Its antiquity has been
doubted, but the near approximation to the keystone
arch seems to be the only argument against the
theory that it was built by the natives, and as we
have seen a very similar arch in the mounds of
Metlaltoyuca, there seems to be no good reason to
attribute it to the Spaniards. This is probably the
bridge known as the Puente de los Bergantines,
where Cortés is said to have launched his brigantines
which rendered so efficient service in the siege of
Mexico. The fact that it is set askew instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529">529</a></span>
crossing the ravine at right angles with the banks
adds greatly to the difficulty of its construction.
Near this place there are also some heaps of débris,
which according to Bullock could be identified in
1823 as small adobe pyramids; and the foundations
of a building and two reservoirs, one of the latter in
good preservation and covered with rose-colored cement,
were mentioned. Beaufoy tells us that in
1826 a serpent's head carved in stone protruded from
the ground near the modern church. A stone column,
seven feet high, was among the relics seen; it
had a well-carved pyramidal piece of hornblende on
its top. Two idols of stone were brought away, one
of them described by Latrobe as "an ugly monster of
an idol in a sitting posture, deftly carved in a hard
volcanic substance."<a id="FNanchor_IX-75" href="#Footnote_IX-75" class="fnanchor">[IX-75]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF TEOTIHUACAN.</p>

<p class="p2">Not quite two miles north-east from the little village
of San Juan, and about twenty-five miles in the
same direction from Mexico, on the road to Otumba,
are the ruins of Teotihuacan, 'city of the gods,' to
which, according to Brasseur, the names Veitioacan,
'city of signals,' and Toltecat are sometimes applied in
the native traditional annals.<a id="FNanchor_IX-76" href="#Footnote_IX-76" class="fnanchor">[IX-76]</a> These monuments stand
on a plain which slopes gently towards the south, and
are included in a rectangular space of about a third
of a mile from east to west and a mile and a half from
north to south, extending from the Tulancingo road
on the north to the Otumba road on the south, with,
however, some small mounds outside of the limits
mentioned. By reason of its nearness to Mexico,
Teotihuacan, like Cholula, has naturally had hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">530</a></span>
of visitors in modern times, and is more or less fully
described by all the early chroniclers. Humboldt,
Bullock, Beaufoy, Ward, Latrobe, Mayer, Thompson,
Tylor, and many other actual visitors have written
accounts, which still others have quoted; but by far
the most complete and reliable account, which is also
the latest, is that given in the report of a scientific
commission appointed by the Mexican government in
1864, accompanied by plates prepared from careful
measurements and photographic views. I have used
this report as my chief authority, carefully noting,
however, all points respecting which other authorities
differ.<a id="FNanchor_IX-77" href="#Footnote_IX-77" class="fnanchor">[IX-77]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The annexed cut, reduced from that of Almaraz,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">531</a></span>
shows clearly, on a scale of about twenty-five hundred
and fifty feet to an inch, the plan of the different
monuments. I shall describe them in the following
order:&mdash;1st. The Pyramid of the Moon, A of the
plan; 2d. The Pyramid of the Sun, B; 3d. The Road
of the Dead, CD; 4th. The Citadel, E; 5th. The
scattered mounds and miscellaneous relics.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOUSE OF THE MOON.</p>

<p>The first pyramid, Metztli Itzacual, 'house of the
moon,' [I find no word in Molina's Vocabulary corresponding
at all to <i>Itzacual</i> with the meaning of
'house.' It may be a compound of <i>calli</i> incorrectly
written] the most northern of the remains, measures
four hundred and twenty-six feet north and south,
and five hundred and eleven feet east and west at the
base, has a summit platform of about thirty-six by
sixty feet, and is a hundred and thirty-seven feet high,
the sides facing almost exactly the cardinal points.<a id="FNanchor_IX-78" href="#Footnote_IX-78" class="fnanchor">[IX-78]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">532</a></span>
The slope of the sides, according to Beaufoy's observations,
is at an angle of about forty-five degrees.
The pyramid, as seen from a little distance, bears
much resemblance to a natural hill, being overgrown
with shrubbery; still the regular original outlines and
angles are much more apparent here than in the case
of Cholula, already described, as is proven by the
photographs taken by the Mexican commission. A
terrace, three feet wide, is plainly visible at a height
of sixty-nine feet from the base, but a close examination
shows there were originally three of these terraces,
dividing the pyramid into four stories, except
on the east, which has no terrace, and where the commission
mentioned claim to have found traces of a
zigzag road leading up the slope, as shown in the
plan. None but the authority referred to have discovered
the zigzag path, and no other explorers note
that the terraces were interrupted on one side of the
pyramid. Humboldt states that the space between
the terraces was divided into smaller grades, or steps,
about three feet high, still visible, and also that there
still remained parts of a stairway of large blocks of
hewn stone. Mr Tylor also says, not referring to this
pyramid particularly: "As we climbed up their sides,
we could trace the terraces without any difficulty, and
even flights of steps." There is hardly any other
American monument respecting which the best authorities
differ so essentially.<a id="FNanchor_IX-79" href="#Footnote_IX-79" class="fnanchor">[IX-79]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">533</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HOUSE OF THE MOON.</p>

<p>The material of the structure has generally been
described as a conglomerate of small irregular stones
and clay, encased, according to Humboldt and most
other writers, in a wall of the porous volcanic
rock, tetzontli; or this facing covered with a
coating of stucco, which is salmon-colored, light
blue, streaked, and red, according to the views of
different observers. The Mexican commissioners disagree
with all previous explorers by doing away
altogether with the facing of hewn stone, and representing
the facing to consist of different conglomerates
arranged in successive layers, as follows:&mdash;1st,
small stones from eight to twelve inches in diameter,
with mud, forming a layer of about thirty-two inches;
2d, fragments of volcanic tufa as large as a man's fist,
also in mud, to the thickness of sixteen inches; 3d,
small grains of tetzontli, of the size of peas, with
mud, twenty-eight inches thick; 4th, a very thin and
smooth coat of pure lime mortar. These layers are
repeated in the same order nine times, and are parallel
to the slopes of the pyramid, which would make
the thickness of the superficial facing about sixty
feet. There have been no excavations sufficiently
deep to show what may be the material in the centre.
Almaraz states that a somewhat different order and
thickness of the strata was observed in certain excavations,
or galleries, to be described later; but none
of these galleries are described as of sufficient depth
to penetrate the facing of sixty feet, and the exact
meaning of the report in question it is very difficult
to determine. I give in a note, however, what others
have said of the building-material.<a id="FNanchor_IX-80" href="#Footnote_IX-80" class="fnanchor">[IX-80]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">534</a></span></p>

<p>The excavation, or gallery, already referred to, extends
about twenty-five feet on an incline into the
pyramid from an entrance on the southern slope,
between the second and third terraces according to
Mayer, about sixty-nine feet above the base according
to Almaraz. It is large enough to permit the
passage of a man on hands and knees, and at its
inner termination are two square wells, walled with
blocks of volcanic tufa three inches thick, or, as
Mayer says, of adobes,&mdash;about five feet square, and
one of them fifteen feet deep. No relics whatever
have been found in connection with gallery or wells;
Almaraz speaks of the former as simply excavations
by treasure-hunters, and mentions only one well,
without stating its location with respect to the gallery.
Mr Löwenstern states that the gallery is a
hundred and fifty-seven feet long, increasing in height
to over six feet and a half, as it penetrates the pyramid;
that the well is over six feet square, extending
apparently down to the base and up to the summit;
and that other cross galleries are blocked up by débris.
Still lower on this slope, at the very base
according to the plan, is a small mound like those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">535</a></span>
scattered over the plain to be described later. Mr
Bullock claims to have found on the summit, in 1823,
walls of rough stones, eight feet high and three feet
thick, forming a square enclosure fourteen by forty-seven
feet, with a doorway on the south, and three
windows on each side. This author's unsupported
statements may be taken always with some allowance
for the play of his imagination.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">HOUSE OF THE SUN.</p>

<p class="p2">Some eight hundred and seventy-five yards south
of the House of the Moon, between it and the Rio
San Juan, at B of the plan, stands the Tonatiuh Itzacual,
or 'house of the sun,' also called sometimes in
tradition, according to Brasseur and Veytia, Tonacatecuhtli,
'god of subsistence.' In material, form,
and construction, it is precisely the same, so far as
my authorities go, as its northern companion; indeed,
many of the remarks which I have quoted in the
preceding description, were applied by the authors to
both pyramids alike. Its dimensions are, however,
considerably larger, and its sides vary about sixteen
degrees from the cardinal points. It measures at
the base seven hundred and thirty-five feet from east
to west, and is two hundred and three feet high.
Beaufoy estimated the size of the summit platform
at sixty by ninety feet.<a id="FNanchor_IX-81" href="#Footnote_IX-81" class="fnanchor">[IX-81]</a></p>

<p>This pyramid is in better condition than the other,
and the three terraces are plainly visible, although as
before no one but Almaraz has discovered that they
do not extend completely round the four sides, and
the latter author states that the zigzag path on the
eastern slope is much more clearly defined and makes
more angles than that on the House of the Moon.
Beaufoy found a path leading up the slope at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">536</a></span>
north-west corner, and Humboldt's remarks about a
stairway of stone blocks may apply to this pyramid
as well as to the other. Bullock states that the second
terrace is thirty-eight feet wide. There are no
traces of buildings on the summit or of galleries in
the interior, but this, like the other pyramid, has a
small mound on one of its sides near the base, and
this mound seems to have embankments connecting it
with the road on the west. The House of the Sun is
also surrounded on the north, south, and east, according
to the report of the Mexican commission, by the
embankment <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, which is a hundred and thirty
feet wide on the summit, and twenty feet high, with
sloping sides, widening out at the extremities, <i>a</i> and
<i>d</i>, into unequal rectangular platforms. It is certainly
very remarkable that among the many visitors
to Teotihuacan no one had found any traces of this
embankment before 1864.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred and fifty yards still further south
across the stream is the Texcalpa, 'citadel,' 'palace,'
or 'stone house,' as it is called, or defined, by different
writers. The Citadel is a quadrangular enclosure,
whose sides measure twelve hundred and forty-six
and thirteen hundred and thirty-eight feet respectively,
or nine hundred and eighty-four feet square according
to Linares, and are exactly parallel with those of the
Pyramid of the Sun. The enclosing walls, or embankments,
are two hundred and sixty-two feet thick and
thirty-three feet high, except on the west side, where
it is but sixteen feet high; their material not being
mentioned, but presumably the same as that of the
pyramids. A cross-embankment of smaller dimensions
divides the square area into two unequal parts, and
on its centre stands a smaller pyramid, said by Linares
to be ninety-two feet high, in ruins, having traces
of a stairway, or path, on its eastern slope. Two small
mounds stand at the western base of the small pyramid,
one is found in the western enclosure, and fourteen,
averaging twenty feet in height, are symmetrically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">537</a></span>
arranged on the summit of the main embankments,
as shown in the plan. The Citadel in some of
its features seems to bear a slight resemblance to the
works at Tenampua, in Honduras, and at Monte Alban,
in Oajaca.<a id="FNanchor_IX-82" href="#Footnote_IX-82" class="fnanchor">[IX-82]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PATH OF THE DEAD.</p>

<p>Just south of the House of the Moon a line of
mounds, C D, forms nearly a circular enclosure
about six hundred feet in diameter, with a small
mound in the centre. From this area two parallel
lines of mounds extend south 15° west, parallel also
with the sides of the House of the Sun and Citadel,
for two hundred and fifty rods to the Rio San Juan,
forming an avenue two hundred and fifty feet wide,
called by the natives, as in the Toltec traditions,
Micaotli, 'path of the dead.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-83" href="#Footnote_IX-83" class="fnanchor">[IX-83]</a> The mounds that
form this avenue are of conical or semispherical form,
and of different dimensions, the largest being over
thirty feet in height. They are built of stone fragments,
earth, and clay, and stand close together, so as
to resemble in some parts a continuous embankment.
Six cross-embankments divide the southern part of the
Path of the Dead into compartments, three of which
have a mound in their centre. Linares represents
the avenue as extending four or five miles beyond
the House of the Moon, to the Cerro de Tlaginga;
and Mayer in his plan terminates it on the south at
a point opposite the House of the Sun, where it is
crossed by the modern path.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MOUNDS OF TEOTIHUACAN.</p>

<p class="p2">Besides the mounds, or <i>tlalteles</i> that form the
Path of the Dead, there are numerous others of the
same form and material&mdash;being, so far as known,
mere heaps of stone and earth&mdash;scattered over the
plain, some of them in lines or groups, with an approach
to regularity, and others with no apparent
arrangement. They vary in height from four or five
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">538</a></span>
to twenty-five or thirty feet. Respecting these tlalteles
I quote from Almaraz as follows: "In them
many excavations have been made, causing most of
the dilapidation which is noted; some of them executed
for scientific purposes in search of archæological
objects; others made by ignorant and rapacious persons,
impelled by a hope of finding falsely reported
treasures: Neither have there been wanting, and
this is the cause of most of the destruction, persons of
evil intentions who undertake to demolish the ruins
in order to obtain the hewn blocks of porphyry which
are used in the construction of their barbarous dwellings;
and they do not even preserve the blocks, but
break and destroy them; in this manner have perished
relics truly precious. Almost under my eyes
there were taken from one of the tlalteles eight hewn
blocks four by three and a half feet; the outer faces
were sculptured, representing a strange and grotesque
figure, with the head of a serpent and of some other
fierce animal, like a tiger or lion; they were curved
on the outside, and all must have formed a circular
monument seventeen feet in diameter; they were
broken up without pity, although I was able to make
a drawing of one of them. In the same tlaltel were
other sculptured stones.... In the houses of San Juan
de Teotihuacan are seen some of these sculptures built
into the walls, and in the Ventilla, near the ruins, I
have seen stones representing in my opinion a serpent....
Of all the objects of this class the most notable
is a monolith found among the débris of a tlaltel,
and of which I give a drawing [see next page.]
It is a parallelopipedon ten feet and a half high, and
five feet and a half wide and thick," weighing, according
to the author's calculations, over fifteen tons.
"I had an excavation made in one of the smallest,
and found four walls meeting at right angles and
forming a square; they are inclined, and within are
found some steps which are parallel to it [the square];
in the upper part of these, begin four other walls also
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">539</a></span>
inclined, containing a little room:&mdash;I thought it was a
tomb, although I have some doubts about its true
object."<a id="FNanchor_IX-84" href="#Footnote_IX-84" class="fnanchor">[IX-84]</a> The people of the vicinity said that in one
of the mounds there had been found a stone box containing
a skull, beads, and various curious relics of
beryl, serpentine, heliotrope, and obsidian. They also
claimed to have found quantities of gold-dust and
gold vases.</p>

<p>Humboldt speaks of hundreds of these mounds
arranged in streets running exactly east and west
and north and south from the pyramids. Mayer's
plan represents a square area partly enclosed by a
line of tlalteles north-east of the House of the Moon.
According to Latrobe, the mounds extend for miles
towards Tezcuco; and Waddy Thompson is confident
that they are the ruins of an ancient city nearly as
large as Mexico. The Citadel he calls the public
square of twenty acres with a stone building in the
centre, and he also finds traces of several other
smaller squares. The streets are marked by large
piles of rock resembling&mdash;except in size&mdash;potato-hills,
formed by falling buildings. In the opinion of this
author it is simply absurd to suppose these heaps to
have been formed as separate mounds. Thompson
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">540</a></span>
also found a number of circular niches two feet in
diameter on the bank of a ravine west of the other
remains.<a id="FNanchor_IX-85" href="#Footnote_IX-85" class="fnanchor">[IX-85]</a></p>

<p>Mayer found, near <i>i</i> of the plan&mdash;as nearly as can
be determined by his plan, which differs considerably
in detail from the one I have given&mdash;a globular mass
of granite nineteen feet eight inches in circumference;
also, near <i>m</i>, the stone block shown in the cut. It is
ten feet and a half long, five feet wide, lies exactly
east and west, and is found in the centre of a group
of small mounds. The cut shows the sculpture on
the face turned toward the south, that on the top and
north being very indistinct. At <i>b</i> of the cut is a hollow
described as three inches deep at the sides, and
six at top and bottom. Notwithstanding Col. Mayer's
opinion to the contrary, it is most natural to regard
this monument as an overturned pillar. The natives
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">541</a></span>

immediately faint.<a id="FNanchor_IX-86" href="#Footnote_IX-86" class="fnanchor">[IX-86]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS RELICS.</p>

<p>At the time of the Conquest statues of the sun and
moon are reported to have been found on the summits
of their respective pyramids. The gold plates which
are said to have covered or decorated these idols were
of course immediately appropriated by the Spanish
soldiers, and the idols themselves broken by order of
the priests. Gemelli Careri claims to have seen fragments
of their arms and legs at the base of the pyramid,
and Ramon del Moral assured Veytia that he
had found the colossal head of the statue of the moon,
and that the pedestal still remained in place; Veytia,
however, could find no traces of such relics in 1757,
although Ixtlilxochitl and Boturini both claim to have
seen them.<a id="FNanchor_IX-87" href="#Footnote_IX-87" class="fnanchor">[IX-87]</a> Mayer claims to have found well-defined
traces of an ancient road covered with cement, between
the ruins and the village. The whole surfaces
of the pyramids, mounds, and much of the surrounding
plain, are literally strewn with the fragments of
pottery and obsidian; and small terra-cotta heads are
offered to the visitor in great quantities for sale, by
the natives, who pick them up among the ruins, or
perhaps manufacture them when their search is not
sufficiently fruitful. Many of these heads have been
brought away and sketched, and they are very similar
one to another. One of them, sketched by Mr
Vetch, is shown in the cut.<a id="FNanchor_IX-88" href="#Footnote_IX-88" class="fnanchor">[IX-88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ruins of Teotihuacan, like the pyramid of
Cholula, contain no internal evidences of their age.
Its building is attributed in different records to the
Toltecs, Olmecs, and Totonacs, in the very earliest
period of Nahua supremacy. The name Teotihuacan
is one of the very earliest preserved in Nahua annals,
and there can be but little doubt that the pyramids are
older than that of Cholula, or that they were built at
least as early as the sixth century, the commencement
of what is regarded as the Toltec era in Anáhuac. The
pyramids themselves served, according to tradition, as
places of sepulture, but not altogether for this purpose,
for Teotihuacan is spoken of as a great centre
of religious worship and priestly rites, a position it
would not have held had it been simply a burial
place. It is altogether probable that the houses of
the Sun and Moon served the double purpose of
tombs and shrines, although there is no proof that
any temples proper ever stood on the summit as at
Cholula. These structures are said to have served as
models for the Aztec teocallis of later times. Don
Lucas Alaman, a distinguished Mexican statesman
and author, believed that the numerous terra-cotta
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">543</a></span>
heads already spoken of were relics distributed by
the priests to the crowds of pilgrims that assembled
at the shrines.<a id="FNanchor_IX-89" href="#Footnote_IX-89" class="fnanchor">[IX-89]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">544</a></span></p>

<p>At Otumba few relics of antiquity seem to have
been discovered; Mayer, however, gives a cut of a
pillar ornamented with geometric sculptured figures,
which is said to have been found by Mr Poinsett. At
Tizayuca, a little north of the lake, a low hill is
spoken of with a small hole in the top, whence issues
continually a current of air; I know not whether there
are evidences of anything artificial about this curious
phenomenon of more than doubtful authenticity.
The same authority also mentions some ruined buildings
on the hacienda of San Miguel.<a id="FNanchor_IX-90" href="#Footnote_IX-90" class="fnanchor">[IX-90]</a> Brasseur de
Bourbourg tells us that the ruins of Quetzalcoatl's
temple at Tulancingo were visible long after the Conquest,
and also speaks of a subterranean palace called
Mictlancalco, and a stone cross discovered on Mount
Meztitlan. Veytia also speaks of the cross of Meztitlan,
sculptured together with a moon on a lofty and
almost inaccessible cliff; and Chaves barely mentions
relics of antiquity not described very definitely.<a id="FNanchor_IX-91" href="#Footnote_IX-91" class="fnanchor">[IX-91]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">OBSIDIAN MINES.</p>

<p class="p2">At the Cerro de las Navajas, near Monte Jacal,
about midway between Real del Monte and Tulancingo,
are the mines or quarries from which the natives
of Anáhuac are believed to have obtained the
large quantities of obsidian used by them in the manufacture
of their implements and weapons. The
mines are described as openings three or four feet in
diameter and one hundred and ten to one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">545</a></span>
and forty feet in extent, probably horizontal, with side
drifts wherever the obsidian is of a desirable quality
and most abundant. Large quantities of the material
are found in fragments of different shapes and sizes,
which throw some light on the manner in which the
Aztecs manufactured their knives and other implements.<a id="FNanchor_IX-92" href="#Footnote_IX-92" class="fnanchor">[IX-92]</a>
In the vicinity of Actopan, at Mixquiahuala,
we are told in a Mexican government report
already often quoted, that clay relics are frequently
discovered.<a id="FNanchor_IX-93" href="#Footnote_IX-93" class="fnanchor">[IX-93]</a> At Atotonilco el Grande, south of Guautla,
Mr Burkart found pieces of obsidian of many-sided
pyramidal form, from which knives had apparently
been split off by the natives in ancient times.
The art of working this intractable material has been
practically lost in modern times.<a id="FNanchor_IX-94" href="#Footnote_IX-94" class="fnanchor">[IX-94]</a></p>

<p>At Zacualtipan, in the north-eastern portion of
Mexico, a very peculiar monument is described, consisting
of a house excavated from a single stone. A
doorway on the south, with columns at its sides, leads
to an apartment measuring about twelve by seven
and a half feet, and ten feet and a half high. The
room contains the remains of a kind of altar and
a sculptured cross. A stone bench extends round
the sides, being two feet high and one foot wide.
This main room is connected by a doorway on the
west with another very narrow one, in the south end
of which is what is described as a kind of stone bed
measuring three by six feet, all of the same stone.
Another stone near by has a bath, so-called, and
still another, known as Caparrosa, has an inscription
painted in red. These remains are of so extraordinary
a character, that in the absence of confirmation
the report must be considered doubtful or erroneous.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">546</a></span>
At Tecomal, north of Lolotla, a stone is mentioned
six feet high, which has six steps leading up to the
summit, where is an oval hole a yard and a half
deep.<a id="FNanchor_IX-95" href="#Footnote_IX-95" class="fnanchor">[IX-95]</a> At Monte Penulco Mr Latrobe speaks of
some remains probably of Spanish origin, like many
others that are attributed to the antiguos.<a id="FNanchor_IX-96" href="#Footnote_IX-96" class="fnanchor">[IX-96]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Near San Juan de los Llanos, in the extreme
north-eastern part of the state, some forty leagues
from the city of Mexico, the existence of a ruined
city was reported late in the eighteenth century on
apparently good authority; but I find no later mention
of it. The description bears some resemblance
to that of Metlaltoyuca, discovered in 1865, just
across the line in Vera Cruz, twenty-five or thirty
miles north-east from San Juan. The two groups of
remains may be identical, or the earlier report may
refer to other monuments, many of which very probably
exist yet undiscovered in that densely wooded
district. The ruined city near San Juan was described
in 1786, by Sr Cañete, as covering an area
of one league by three fourths of a league, surrounded
by walls of hewn stone laid without mortar,
five to eight feet high and very thick. A street running
from east to west was paved with volcanic stone,
worn smooth, and guarded by battlements, or side
walls. Several ruined temples, sculptured blocks of
stone, stone metates and other implements, stone
statues of men and animals&mdash;including a lion&mdash;were
found here, but all of a rather coarse workmanship.
A tall pine was growing on the summit of one of
the temples, and there seemed to be some evidence
that the town had been abandoned for want of a
supply of water.<a id="FNanchor_IX-97" href="#Footnote_IX-97" class="fnanchor">[IX-97]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Earthen Vase&mdash;Tula.</p>
</div>

<p>At Tula, north-west of the city of Mexico, the
ancient Tollan, the Toltec capital, we are told that
extensive ruins remained at the time of the Conquest,<a id="FNanchor_IX-98" href="#Footnote_IX-98" class="fnanchor">[IX-98]</a>
but very few relics have survived to the present
time, although some of the few that have been
found here are of a somewhat extraordinary character.
The cut shows both sides of an earthen vase from
Tula, which, as Mayer says, is "of exquisitely grained
and tempered material, and ornamented with figures
in <i>intaglio</i>, resembling those found on the monuments
in Yucatan."<a id="FNanchor_IX-99" href="#Footnote_IX-99" class="fnanchor">[IX-99]</a> Villa-Señor y Sanchez, one of the
early Spanish writers, names Tula as one of the many
localities where giants' bones had been found.<a id="FNanchor_IX-100" href="#Footnote_IX-100" class="fnanchor">[IX-100]</a> A
commission from the Mexican Geographical Society,
composed of Drs Manfred and Ord,&mdash;the latter an
old resident of California, who takes a deep interest
in the antiquities and history of the Pacific States&mdash;with
Mr Porter C. Bliss,&mdash;whose large collection of
Mexican works, with some curious relics of antiquity,
has been lately added to my library&mdash;and Sr García
y Cubas, made an exploration of Tula and vicinity in
1873, bringing to light some interesting monuments,
of which an illustrated account was published in the
Boletin of the society. The cut shows a very curious
double column of basalt, somewhat over eight feet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">548</a></span>
high. The sculptured knots are interpreted by the
commissioners mentioned as the <i>tlalpilli</i>, or periods
of thirteen years. None of them occur on the reverse
of the column. Other relics discovered by this party
included half of what seemed to be a kind of calendar-stone,
a large animal in basalt or monster idol,
and some hieroglyphic sculptures on the cliff of the
Cerro de la Malinche. There were also found the
three fragments shown in the cut, which are interesting
as showing an aboriginal method of forming columns
not elsewhere met with in America, a round
tenon on one part fitting closely into a hole in the
next. The largest of the three parts shown is four
feet long and two and three fourths feet in diameter.
The material is basalt and the sculpture is said to be
well done. Most of the Tula relics were found at the
Cerro del Tesoro, west of the modern village.<a id="FNanchor_IX-101" href="#Footnote_IX-101" class="fnanchor">[IX-101]</a></p>

stone, about nine feet long, recently discovered on the

sculptured.<a id="FNanchor_IX-102" href="#Footnote_IX-102" class="fnanchor">[IX-102]</a> Another author says that on the same
hacienda an idol six feet high has been found,<a id="FNanchor_IX-103" href="#Footnote_IX-103" class="fnanchor">[IX-103]</a> and
mentions some ruins of dwellings about Jacala in the
Tula district, especially at Santa María de los Alamos
and Cerro Prieto, and also a pillar in the middle of the
Rio de Montezuma.<a id="FNanchor_IX-104" href="#Footnote_IX-104" class="fnanchor">[IX-104]</a> Other remains vaguely reported
to exist in this part of the state include a subterranean
arch at Huehuetoca, between Mexico and Tula, built
by the natives to keep the water from the capital;
and a group of ruins at Chilcuautla, among which are
those of a temple of stone and mortar, and a pyramid
fifty-five feet long and seven feet high, with steps in
a good state of preservation.<a id="FNanchor_IX-105" href="#Footnote_IX-105" class="fnanchor">[IX-105]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Still further north-west in the state of Querétaro,
three groups of antiquities are reported, but very inadequately
described. At Pueblito a league and a
half south of the city of Querétaro, said to have
been a favorite resort for Mexican tourists and invalids
in the last century, there stood on a natural elevation,
in 1777, the foundations of a large rectangular
building. The walls were built of stones laid in clay,
and were not, when visited, standing above the level
of the ground, one or two feet having been, however,
brought to light by excavation. On the east and
west of the main building were two smaller ones,
from which many idols and other relics, including
round polished stones pierced through the centre, are
said to have been taken. A pavement of clay is also
spoken of in connection with these ruins. On the
same elevation stood an artificial sugar-loaf-shaped
mound, built of alternate layers of loose stones and
mud, having at its summit a level mesa thirty-three
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">550</a></span>
feet in diameter. It is said that many idols, sculptured
fragments, pedestals, architectural decorations,
and flint arrow-heads from Pueblito, were sent to
enrich collections in the city of Mexico. The only
writer on the subject, Sr Morfi, attempts some descriptions
of the sculpture, but as is usual with such
accounts unaccompanied by cuts, they convey no idea
whatever of the subjects treated. Certain adobe
ruins of doubtful antiquity were also shown to the
author mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_IX-106" href="#Footnote_IX-106" class="fnanchor">[IX-106]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CANOAS AND RANAS.</p>

<p>In the Sierra de Canoas, between thirty and forty
miles north-east of Querétaro, is a steep hill known
as Cerro de la Ciudad, the summit of which is very
strongly fortified. A lithographic plate showing a
general view of the hill is given in a Mexican government
report, but I do not copy it because the
view is too distant to show anything further than
what has already been said; namely, that the hill is
steep, and the summit covered with strong stone
fortifications. Another plate shows simply the arrangement
of the stones, which are brick-shaped
blocks, whose dimensions are not given, laid in a
mortar of reddish clay and lime. There are in all
forty-five defensive works on the hill, including a
wall about forty feet in height, and a rectangular
platform with an area of five thousand square feet.
Some large trees, one of them three hundred years
old by its rings, are growing over the ruins. It is
very unfortunate that we have no ground plan of
these fortifications.<a id="FNanchor_IX-107" href="#Footnote_IX-107" class="fnanchor">[IX-107]</a></p>

<p>Two or three leagues north-west of the ruins last
mentioned is the ranchería of Ranas, situated in a
small valley enclosed by hills on every side, on the
summits of most of which are still to be seen traces
of an ancient population. The fortifications on these
hills seem to resemble, so far as may be determined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">551</a></span>
by the slight accounts extant, those of the barranca-girt
peninsular plateaux of Vera Cruz. One hill-summit
on the north has a pyramid sixty-five feet
square at the base, with four stairways leading to
the top. Near the pyramid is a burial mound, or
<i>cuicillo</i>, in which with a human skeleton were found
marine shells, pottery, and beads. The cuicillos are
numerous throughout the whole region, and marine
shells are of frequent occurrence in them. From a
mound in the vicinity of San Juan Del Rio some
idols were taken as well.<a id="FNanchor_IX-108" href="#Footnote_IX-108" class="fnanchor">[IX-108]</a></p>

<p>From an article read before the Mexican Geographical
Society by Sr Ballesteros in 1872, I quote the
following extracts: "What all down to the present
time called cities (Canoas and Ranas), are only the
fortified points which guarded the city proper, which
was situated between the two at the point called Ranas,
where was the residence of the monarch. In a
region absolutely broken up and cut in all directions
by enormous barrancas, caused by the sinking of whole
mountains, the settlement could not be symmetrically
laid out, but was scattered, as it is still found, in the
bottom of ravines, on the slopes and tops of the hills for
many leagues." A small lake, and a perennial spring
are supposed to have been the attractions of this
locality in the eyes of the ancient people. "On all
the hills about are still seen vestiges of their monuments,
particularly what are called cuicillos, scattered
in every direction from the pueblo of El Doctor to the
banks of the streams that drain the valley opposite
Zimapan, and even to that of Estorax. Although
beforehand I believed that the capital was situated in
the central part of Ranas, still this idea was rather
vague; but now I think I may be sure of it, since I
have found a place surrounded with little elevations,
with all the signs of a circular plaza, with many remains
of monuments, which have been destroyed
through ignorance and greed. In my presence were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">552</a></span>
destroyed the last remains of a cuicillo to found a house,
the work not being checked by the presence of the bodies
of a man and woman, whose skulls, which I wished
to remove, were reduced to dust by the simple touch
of the hand. This circumstance may serve to-day as
a proof that the cuicillos are nothing but mortuary
monuments erected over the sepulchres of persons of
rank, more or less grand according to the power of
the pueblo, or of the relatives of the deceased." "The
idea of a remote antiquity is proved by the presence
of the remains of very large oaks which sprang up
among the edifices, grew and died, and from the ashes
of which others equally large have grown up and
cover to-day the majestic remains with their shade."
"The summit of the hill on which it [the fortification]
was founded is somewhat over a quarter of a league
long, and between wall and wall there is room for
three thousand men without crowding. The terrible
sinking of the mountains cut down the cliffs, which
are perpendicular on the north to a height of over
eleven hundred feet. On the brow of the cliff was
built the superimposed wall of stone, of a very considerable
thickness, and terraced on the interior where
the warriors were sheltered. On the highest part of
the wall there is a kind of tower, the height of which
from the bottom of the ravine is not less than sixteen
hundred and fifty feet. The hill has only one entrance,
but at the same time it has three projecting
points which impeded the enemy from approaching in
sufficient numbers to make an assault. At this same
point is the tower which was perhaps the residence of
the chief of the fortress, the view from which commanded
the only two roads by which the enemies
could approach." "The two fortifications (Canoas and
Ranas) are about two leagues distant one from the
other, and throughout the whole extent are seen the
remains of the settlement, which territory the natives
still inhabit. That of Canoas guards the entrance of
Zimapan by way of Santo Domingo and Maconí; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">553</a></span>
that of Ranas protects the approach to Cadereyta
and Piñal de Amoles."<a id="FNanchor_IX-109" href="#Footnote_IX-109" class="fnanchor">[IX-109]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MISCELLANEOUS REMAINS.</p>

<p class="p2">I have now mentioned all the relics of antiquity
that have been found in stated localities within the
central Mexican region, which was to constitute the
geographical basis of this chapter. Besides these
relics, however, there are very many others in antiquarian
collections, public or private, in different parts
of the world, respecting which all that is known is
that they are Mexican, that is, were brought from
some part of the Mexican Republic, or even from
the northern Central American states. Probably a
larger part did actually originate in that part of the
Republic which has been treated of in the present
and the two preceding chapters. Very few, if any,
came from the broad northern regions, whose few
scattered remains will form the subject of the following
chapter. Neither do the general remarks of different
writers on Mexican antiquities refer, except
very slightly, to any northern monuments; consequently

from all parts of the country, are described by travelers
as very rich, but little cared for. The public
collections were gradually united in the National
Museum, where it is to be supposed they are still
preserved and cared for under government auspices.
M. de Waldeck at one time undertook the work of
publishing lithographic plates of the relics in the
Museum, but never completed it, and so far as I
know no systematic catalogue has ever been given to
the public. Every visitor to the city has had something
to say of these monuments, but most have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">554</a></span>
given their attention to the calendar-stone, and a few
other well-known and famous objects. Many copies
have been made by traveling artists, and such is the
source whence many of the cuts in the preceding
pages have been taken. Respecting the various
private collections of Mexico, frequently changing
hands, and scattered more or less to foreign lands at
every succeeding revolution, I do not deem it important
to notice them in this place, especially as I have
no information about their present number and condition,
or the effects of the French intervention.</p>

<p>M. de Fossey represents the Museum as containing
"a hundred masks of obsidian, of serpentine, and
of marble; a collection of vases of marble and clay;
implements in clay, in wood, and in stone; metallic
mirrors; amulets and ornaments in agate, coral,
and shell," all in great confusion.<a id="FNanchor_IX-110" href="#Footnote_IX-110" class="fnanchor">[IX-110]</a> Mr Mayer gives
perhaps the most complete account of the monuments
gathered in this and some other collections in the
city of Mexico, illustrated by many cuts besides those
which I have had occasion to copy or to mention in
describing the monuments of particular localities. I
make some quotations from this author respecting
miscellaneous objects. "In the city of Mexico I
constantly saw serpents, carved in stone, in the various
collections of antiquities. One was presented to
me by the Conde del Peñasco, and the drawings below
represent the figures of two 'feathered serpents,'
which, after considerable labor I disinterred (I may
say,) from a heap of dirt and rubbish, old boxes,
chicken-coops, and decayed fruit, in the court-yard of
the University." "The carving with which they are
covered is executed with a neatness and gracefulness
that would make them, as mere ornaments, worthy of
the chisel of an ancient sculptor." "On the benches
around the walls, and scattered over the floor, are
numberless figures of dogs, monkeys, lizards, birds,
serpents, all in seemingly inextricable confusion and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">555</a></span>
utter neglect." A mortar of basalt with a coiled
serpent round the rim, and a beautifully cut human
head of the same material. "In the adjoining cases
[of the Museum] are all the smaller Mexican antiquities,
which have been gathered together by the
labor of many years, and arranged with some attention
to system. In one department you find the
hatchets used by the Indians; the ornaments of beads
of obsidian and stone worn round their necks; the
mirrors of obsidian; the masks of the same material,
which they hung at different seasons before the faces
of their idols; their bows and arrows, and arrow-heads
of obsidian, some of them so small and beautifully
cut, that the smallest birds might be killed
without injuring their plumage. In another department
are the smaller idols of the ancient Indians, in
clay and stone, specimens of which, together with
the small domestic altars and vases for burning incense,
are exhibited in the following [7] drawings.
Many of these figures were doubtless worn suspended
around the neck, or hung on the walls of houses, as
several are pierced with holes, through which cords
have evidently passed. In the next place is a collection
of Mexican vases and cups, most of which
were discovered ... in the Island of Sacrificios," and
have consequently been already mentioned. There
follow cuts of an axe and two pipes; nine small clay
idols; and seven musical instruments. Sixteen cuts of
objects from the Peñasco collection are also given.<a id="FNanchor_IX-111" href="#Footnote_IX-111" class="fnanchor">[IX-111]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Bronze Bells&mdash;Christy Collection.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Tylor tells us that the Uhde collection at Heidelberg
is a far finer one than that in Mexico, except
in the department of picture-writings; it contains a
large number of stone idols and trinkets, pipes, and
calendars. The Christy collection in London is particularly
rich in small sculptured figures, many of
them from Central America. It includes the squatting
female figure carved from hard black basalt,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">556</a></span>
fifteen inches high and seven and a half inches wide,
described by Humboldt as an Aztec priestess;<a id="FNanchor_IX-112" href="#Footnote_IX-112" class="fnanchor">[IX-112]</a> and
also bronze needles and the bronze bells shown in the
cut, which I take from Tylor. The same author also
describes and illustrates various other relics seen by
him in Mexican and European collections. These include
stone and obsidian knives, spear-heads, and
arrow-heads; heads and small idols in terra cotta;
pottery, consisting of vases, altars, censers, rattles,
flageolets, and whistles; and masks of obsidian, stone,
wood, and terra-cotta. Respecting obsidian relics
Mr Tylor says, "Anyone who does not know obsidian
may imagine great masses of bottle-glass, such as our
orthodox ugly wine bottles are made of, very hard,
very brittle, and&mdash;if one breaks it with any ordinary
implement&mdash;going, as glass does, in every direction
but the right one." "Out of this rather unpromising
stuff the Mexicans made knives, razors, arrow- and
spear-heads, and other things, some of great beauty.
I say nothing of the polished obsidian mirrors and
ornaments, nor even of the curious masks of the human
face that are to be seen in collections, for these
were only laboriously cut and polished with jewelers'
sand, to us a common-place process." "We got several
obsidian maces or lance-heads&mdash;one about ten
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557">557</a></span>
inches long&mdash;which were taper from base to point, and
covered with taper flutings; and there are other things
which present great difficulties." "The axes and
chisels of stone are so exactly like those found in Europe
that it is quite impossible to distinguish them.
The bronze hatchet-blades are thin and flat, slightly
thickened at the sides to give them strength, and
mostly of a very peculiar shape, something like a <img src="images/t-30.jpg" width="11" height="10" alt="T" />,
but still more resembling the section of a mushroom
cut vertically through the middle of the stalk."<a id="FNanchor_IX-113" href="#Footnote_IX-113" class="fnanchor">[IX-113]</a>
These supposed hatchets were, according to some authorities,
coins. They are extremely light to be used
as hatchets. "Many specimens are to be seen of the
red and black ware of Cholula." "The terra-cotta
rattles are very characteristic. They have little balls
in them which shake about, and they puzzled us
much as the apple-dumpling did good King George,
for we could not make out very easily how the balls
got inside. They were probably attached very slightly
to the inside, and so baked and then broken loose."
A cut is given of a brown lava mask from the Christy
collection, which seems to have some sculptured figures
on the inside.<a id="FNanchor_IX-114" href="#Footnote_IX-114" class="fnanchor">[IX-114]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Mosaic Knife&mdash;Christy Collection.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">MOSAIC WORK.</p>

<p>There are three very remarkable mosaic relics in
the Christy collection, one of which is the knife represented
in the cut, which I take from Waldeck's fine
colored plate, although most of the information respecting
these relics comes from Tylor. The blade is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">558</a></span>
of a semi-translucent chalcedony found in the volcanic
regions of Mexico. The uncolored cut gives but a
faint idea of the beauty of the handle, which is covered
with a complicated mosaic work of a bright
green turquoise, malachite, and both white and red
shell. It is certainly most extraordinary to find a
people still in the stone age, as is proved by the blade,
able to execute so perfect a piece of work as the
handle exhibits. Two masks of the same style of
workmanship are preserved in the same collection.
"The mask of wood is covered with minute pieces of
turquoise&mdash;cut and polished, accurately fitted, many
thousands in number, and set on a dark gum or cement.
The eyes, however, are acute-oval patches of
mother-of-pearl; and there are two small square
patches of the same on the temples, through which a
string passed to suspend the mask; and the teeth are
of hard white shell. The eyes are perforated, and so
are the nostrils, and the upper and lower teeth are
separated by a transverse chink.... The face, which
is well-proportioned, pleasing, and of great symmetry,
is studded also with numerous projecting pieces of
turquoise, rounded and polished." The wood is the
fragrant cedar or cypress of Mexico. The knife
handle is "sculptured in the form of a crouching human
figure, covered with the skin of an eagle, and
presenting the well-known and distinctive Aztec type
of the human head issuing from the mouth of an animal."
"The second mask is yet more distinctive.
The incrustation of turquoise-mosaic is placed on the
forehead, face, and jaws of a human skull.... The
mosaic of turquoise is interrupted by three broad
transverse bands, on the forehead, face, and chin, of a
mosaic of obsidian similarly cut (but in larger pieces)
and highly polished,&mdash;a very unusual treatment of this
difficult and intractable material, the use of which in
any artistic way, appears to have been confined to the
Aztecs (with the exception, perhaps, of the Egyptians).
The eye-balls are nodules of iron-pyrites, cut hemispherically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559">559</a></span>
and highly polished, and are surrounded
by circles of hard white shell, similar to that forming
the teeth of the wooden mask. The Aztecs made
their mirrors of iron-pyrites polished, and are the
only people who are known to have put this material
to ornamental use." These mosaic relics, and two
similar but damaged masks at Copenhagen, are probably
American, if not Aztec; but this cannot be
directly proved; for while something is known of their
European history, their origin cannot be definitely ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_IX-115" href="#Footnote_IX-115" class="fnanchor">[IX-115]</a></p>

although he gives no reason for the opinion;
nor does he name the material, or dimensions of the
relic. Sr Chavero also speaks of several images of

solid gold. Several had a well-defined beard.<a id="FNanchor_IX-116" href="#Footnote_IX-116" class="fnanchor">[IX-116]</a> Gondra
gives plates of many weapons, implements of

<p>In 1831 a report was made to the French Geographical
Society on a collection of drawings of
Mexican antiquities executed by M. Franck. This
collection embraced drawings of about six hundred
objects, most of them from the National Museum in
Mexico; eighty in the museum of the Philosophical
Society at Philadelphia; forty in the Peñasco collection
in Mexico, and others belonging to Castañeda
and other private individuals. They were classified as
follows: one hundred and eighty figures of men and
women; fifty-five human heads in stone or clay; thirty
masks and busts; twenty heads of different animals;
seventy-five vases; forty ornaments; six bas-reliefs;
six fragments; thirty-three flageolets and whistles;

<p>Sixteen specimens of Mexican relics, in the possession
of M. Latour-Allard in Paris, are represented
by Kingsborough unaccompanied by explanations.
The objects are mostly sculptured heads, idols, and
animals. Bullock also gives plates of six Mexican
idols, about which nothing definite is said; Humboldt
pictures an idol carried by him from Mexico to
Berlin; and Nebel's plates show about thirty miscellaneous
relics, in addition to those that have been
already mentioned. Humboldt also gives an Aztec
hatchet of green feldspath or jade, which has incised
figures on its surface. He remarks that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">561</a></span>
never has found this material 'in place' in Mexico,
although axes made of it are common enough.<a id="FNanchor_IX-119" href="#Footnote_IX-119" class="fnanchor">[IX-119]</a> The
two musical instruments shown in the cuts are taken
from Waldeck's plates. Their material is terra

Del Rio and Cabrera.<a id="FNanchor_IX-121" href="#Footnote_IX-121" class="fnanchor">[IX-121]</a> José María Bustamante
told Mr Lyon of an obsidian ring, carried away by
Humboldt, which was perforated round the circumference

as a 'cosa muy curiosa.'</p>

<img src="images/i563.jpg" width="243" height="316" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Serpentine Hieroglyphic Block.</p>
</div>

<p>Four interesting sculptured stones are represented
and their inscriptions interpreted by Sr Ramirez, in
a Spanish edition of Prescott's work. The first is a
cylinder twenty-six inches long, eleven inches in diameter,
representing a bundle of straight sticks bound
with a double rope at each end. There are hieroglyphic
sculptures on one side and both ends, which
are interpreted by Sr Ramirez as a record of the
feast which was celebrated at the last 'binding up of
the years' in 1507. The second is a block of black
lava thirteen and a half by twelve and a half inches,
bearing a serpent carved in low relief. The third is
a similar block somewhat larger, with a sculptured
inscription, supposed to represent the date of November
28, 1456. The fourth monument is that shown
in the cut. It is a block of green serpentine, measuring
thirty-eight by twenty-six inches. According
to the meaning attributed to the sculptures by Ramirez,
the lower inscription is the year 8 Acatl, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">564</a></span>
1487; the upper part shows the day 7 Acatl, or February
19. The left hand figure is supposed to represent
Ahuitzotl, and that on the right Tizoc. The
event commemorated by the whole sculpture is
thought to be the dedication of the great temple of
Mexico, begun by Tizoc and completed by Ahuitzotl.
The same block is shown in one of Waldeck's
plates.<a id="FNanchor_IX-125" href="#Footnote_IX-125" class="fnanchor">[IX-125]</a> I may also notice a small collection of
Mexican relics in my possession, obtained by Porter
C. Bliss during his travels in the country. This collection
includes a grotesque mask of clay; a head of
terra-cotta, eight inches high and six inches wide, including
head-dress; a small head carved from limestone;
a wooden teponaztli; a copper coin or hatchet;
five terra-cotta faces, whose dimensions are generally
about two inches; six fragments of pottery, mostly ornamented
with raised and indented figures&mdash;one with
raised figures added after the vessel was completed,
one with painted figures, one glazed, and one apparently
engraved; and seven fragments, some of which
seem to have been handles or legs of large vessels.</p>

<p>I close my description of Mexican Antiquities with
the two following quotations, somewhat at variance
with the matter contained in the preceding pages.
"This, like other American countries, is of too recent
civilization to exhibit any monuments of antiquity."<a id="FNanchor_IX-126" href="#Footnote_IX-126" class="fnanchor">[IX-126]</a>
"I am informed by a person who resided long in New
Spain and visited almost every province of it, that
there is not, in all the extent of that vast empire, any
monument or vestige of any building more ancient
than the conquest, nor of any bridge or highway, except
some remains of the causeway from Guadaloupe
to the gate of Mexico."<a id="FNanchor_IX-127" href="#Footnote_IX-127" class="fnanchor">[IX-127]</a> I give in a note a list of
authorities which contain descriptions more or less
complete of Mexican relics, but no information in addition
to what has been presented.<a id="FNanchor_IX-128" href="#Footnote_IX-128" class="fnanchor">[IX-128]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565">565</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">NAHUA MONUMENTS.</p>

<p>No general view or résumé of Nahua monuments
seems necessary here, nor are extensive concluding
remarks called for, in addition to what has been said
in connection with particular groups of monuments,
and to the conclusions which the reader of the preceding
pages will naturally form. The most important
bearing of the monuments as a whole is as a
confirmation of the Nahua civilization as it was found
to exist in the sixteenth century, reported in the
pages of the conquerors and early chroniclers, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566">566</a></span>
it has been exhibited in a preceding volume. That
there were exaggerations in the reports that have
come down to us is doubtless true, as it is very
natural; but a people who could execute the works
that have been described and pictured in this and the
two preceding chapters, were surely far advanced in
many of the elements of what is termed civilization.
And all this they did, it must be remembered, while
practically still in their 'stone age;' for although copper
was used by them, it has been seen that implements
of that metal but rarely occur in the list of
relics described. It is doubtful if any known people
ever advanced so far under similar circumstances&mdash;that
is in their 'stone age,' or in the earlier stages of
their 'bronze age'&mdash;as did the Nahuas and Mayas of
this continent.</p>

<p>Not only do the northern monuments confirm the
reported culture existing at the Conquest, but they
agree, so far as they go, with the traditional annals
of Anáhuac during the centuries preceding the coming
of the Spaniards. Teotihuacan and Cholula differ
from any works of the later Nahua epochs; while
Xochicalco and Mitla are far superior to any known
works of the Aztecs proper. All remains sustain the
traditions that the Aztecs were superior to their neighbors
chiefly in the arts of war, and that the older inhabitants
were more devoted to the arts of architecture
and sculpture, if not more skillful in the practice of
them, than their successors. Still, this must not be
understood to indicate anything like a permanent deterioration,
or the beginning of a backward march of
civilization, whose march is ever onward, although
making but little account of centuries or generations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NAHUA AND MAYA RELICS.</p>

<p>The comparison of Nahua with Maya monuments
is a most interesting subject, into the details of which
I do not propose to enter. In the use of the pyramidal
structure, common to both branches of American
civilized nations, and in a few sculptured emblems
there is doubtless a resemblance; but this likeness is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">567</a></span>
utterly insufficient to support what has been in the
past a favorite theory among writers on the subject;&mdash;namely,
that of a civilized people migrating slowly
southward, and leaving behind them traces of a gradually
improving but identical culture. The resemblances
in question have in my opinion been greatly
exaggerated, and are altogether outnumbered and
outweighed by the marked contrasts, which, as they
exist between the monuments of Yucatan and Chiapas,
and those of Mexico and Vera Cruz, do not need
to be pointed out to one who has studied the preceding
descriptions. It is true that the best architectural
specimens of Nahua art have been entirely
destroyed, still there is no reason to doubt that if
they could be partially restored they would resemble
the structures of Vera Cruz, or at best, Xochicalco,
rather than those of Uxmal and Palenque.</p>

<p>The differences between the northern and southern
remains, while far more clearly marked than the resemblances,
and constituting a much more forcible
argument against than in favor of the theory that
all American peoples are identical, must yet not be
regarded as in any way conclusive in the matter; for
it may be noticed that the likeness is very vague between
the Nicaraguan idols of stone and those carved
by the hands of the northern Aztecs. Yet the
peoples were doubtless identical in blood and language,
as the divinities which the respective artists
attempted to symbolize in stone were the same.
The reader will probably agree with me in the conclusion
that, while a comparison of northern and
southern monuments is far from proving or disproving
the original identity of the Civilized Races of
the Pacific States, yet it goes far to show, in connection
with the evidence of language, tradition, and
institutions, a Nahua and a Maya culture, progressing
in separate paths,&mdash;though not without contact, friction,
and intermingling,&mdash;during a long course of centuries.

<p>A somewhat irregular line extending across the
continent from north-east to south-west, terminating
at Tampico on the gulf and at the bar of Zacatula on
the Pacific, is the limit which the progress northward
of our antiquarian exploration has reached, the results
having been recorded in the preceding chapters. The
region that now remains to be traversed, excepting
the single state of Michoacan, the home of the Tarascos,
is without the limits that have been assigned to
the Civilized Nations, and within the bounds of comparative
savagism. The northern states of what is
now the Mexican Republic were inhabited at the
time of the Conquest by the hundreds of tribes, which,
if not all savages, had at least that reputation among
their southern brethren. To the proud resident of
Anáhuac and the southern plateaux, the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569">569</a></span>
hordes were Chichimecs, 'dogs,' barbarians. Yet several
of these so-called barbarian tribes were probably
as far advanced in certain elements of civilization as
some of the natives that have been included among
the Nahuas. They were tillers of the soil and lived
under systematic forms of government, although not
apparently much given to the arts of architecture and
sculpture. Only one grand pile of stone ruins is
known to exist in the whole northern Chichimec region,
and the future discovery of others, though possible,
is not, I think, very likely to occur. Nor are
smaller relics, idols and implements, very numerous,
except in a few localities; but this may be attributed
perhaps in great degree to the want of thorough exploration.
A short chapter will suffice for a description
of all the monuments south of United States
territory, and in describing them I shall treat of
each state separately, proceeding in general terms
from south to north. A glance at the <a href="#map">map</a> accompanying
this volume will show the reader the position
of each state, and each group of remains, more clearly
than any verbal location could do.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">TARASCAN MONUMENTS.</p>

<p class="p2">The civilized Tarascos of Michoacan have left but
very few traces in the shape of material relics. Their
capital and the centre of their civilization was on the
shores and islands of Lake Patzcuaro, where the
Spaniards at the time of the Conquest found some
temples described by them as magnificent.<a id="FNanchor_X-1" href="#Footnote_X-1" class="fnanchor">[X-1]</a> Beaumont
tells us that the ruins of a 'plaza de armas' belonging
traditionally to the Tarascos at Tzintzuntzan,
the ancient capital, were still visible in 1776, near
the pueblo of Ignatzio, two leagues distant. Five
hundred paces west of the pueblo a wall, mostly
fallen, encloses a kind of plaza, measuring four hundred
and fourteen by nine hundred and thirty feet.
The wall was about sixteen feet thick and eighteen
in height, with terraces, or steps, on the inside. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570">570</a></span>
the centre were the foundations of what the author
supposes to have been a tower, and west of the enclosed
area were three heaps of stones, supposed to
be burial mounds. Two idols, one in human form,
lacking head and feet, the other shaped like an alligator,
were found here, carved from a stone called
<i>tanamo</i>, much like the tetzontli. The same author
says, "respecting the ruins of the palace of the Tarascan
kings, according to the examination which I
lately made of these curiosities, I may say that eastward
of this city of Tzintzuntzan, on the slope of a
great hill called Yaguarato, a hundred paces from the
settlement, are seen on the surface of the ground
some subterranean foundations, which extend from
north to south about a hundred and fifty paces, and
about fifty from east to west, where there is a tradition
that the palace of the ancient kings was situated.
In the centre of the foundation-stones are five small
mounds, or cuicillos, which are called stone <i>yacatas</i>,
and hewn blocks, over which an Indian guardian is
never wanting, for even now the natives will not permit
these stones to be removed." "On the shores of
Lake Siraguen are found ancient monuments of the
things which served for the pleasure of the kings and
nobles, with other ruined edifices, which occur in
various places."<a id="FNanchor_X-2" href="#Footnote_X-2" class="fnanchor">[X-2]</a> Tzintzuntzan is on the south-eastern
shore of the lake, some leagues northward from the
modern Patzcuaro. Lyon in later times was told
that the royal palace and other interesting remains
were yet to be seen on the lake shores, but he did not
visit them.<a id="FNanchor_X-3" href="#Footnote_X-3" class="fnanchor">[X-3]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TEREMENDO AND ANICHE.</p>

<p>Another early writer, Villa-Señor y Sanchez, says
that in 1712 he, with a companion, entered what
seemed a cavern in a deep barranca at Teremendo,
eight leagues south-west of Valladolid, or Morelia.
"There were discovered prodigious aboriginal vaults,
bounded by very strong walls, rendered solid by fire.
In the centre of the second was a bench like the foot
of an altar, where there were many idols, and fresh
offerings of copal, and woolen stuffs, and various
figures of men and animals." It was found according
to this author that the builders had constructed
walls of loose stones of a kind easily melted, and
then by fire had joined the blocks into a solid mass
without the use of mortar, continuing the process to
the roof. The outside of the structure was overgrown
with shrubs and trees.<a id="FNanchor_X-4" href="#Footnote_X-4" class="fnanchor">[X-4]</a></p>

<p class="p2">At Aniche, an island in Lake Patzcuaro, Mr
Beaufoy discovered some hieroglyphic figures cut on
a rock; and at Irimbo about fifty miles east of
Morelia, he was shown some small mounds which
the natives called fortifications, although there was
nothing to indicate that such had been their use.<a id="FNanchor_X-5" href="#Footnote_X-5" class="fnanchor">[X-5]</a> In
the mountains south-east of Lake Chapala, in the
region of Jiquilpan, Sr García reports the remains of
an ancient town, and says further that opals and
other precious stones well worked have been obtained
here.<a id="FNanchor_X-6" href="#Footnote_X-6" class="fnanchor">[X-6]</a> Humboldt pictures a very beautiful obsidian
bracelet or ring, worked very thin and brilliantly
polished; and another writer mentions some giants'
bones, all found within the limits of Michoacan.<a id="FNanchor_X-7" href="#Footnote_X-7" class="fnanchor">[X-7]</a></p>

<p class="p2">At the time when official explorations were undertaken
by Dupaix and Castañeda in the southern parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572">572</a></span>
of New Spain, it seems that officials in some northern
regions also were requested by the Spanish government
to report upon such remains of antiquity as
might be known to exist. The antiquarian genius
to whom the matter was referred in Colima, then a
department of Michoacan, but now an independent
state, made a comprehensive report to the effect that
he "had not been able to hear of anything except an
infinite number of edifices of ruined towns," and some
bones and other remains apparently of little importance,
which had been taken from excavations on the
hacienda of Armería and Cuyutlan, and which seemed
to have been destroyed and covered up by volcanic
eruptions. If this archæologist had found more than
'an infinite number' of ruins, it might possibly have
occurred to him to describe some of them.<a id="FNanchor_X-8" href="#Footnote_X-8" class="fnanchor">[X-8]</a> Nothing
more is known of Colima antiquities.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">PYRAMID OF TEPATITLAN.</p>

<p class="p2">At Tonala, probably just across the Colima line
northward in the state of Jalisco, the report sent in
reply to the inquiry just spoken of, mentioned a hill
which seemed to be for the most part artificial, and
in which excavations revealed walls, galleries, and
rooms. Similar works were said to be of frequent
occurrence in that region. In digging for the foundations
of the Royal Hospital at Guadalajara, "there
was found a cavity, or subterranean vault, well
painted, and several statues, especially one which
represents an Indian woman in the act of grinding
corn." It was hollow, and probably of clay. Near
Autlan, in the south-west, there were said to exist
some traces of feet sculptured in the rock, one at the
ford called Zopilote, and another on the road between
Autlan and Tepanola. Near Chacala, still further
south, "there is a tank, and near it a cross well
carved, and on its foot certain ancient unknown letters,
with points in five lines. On it was seen a most
devoted crucifix. Under it are other lines of characters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573">573</a></span>
with the said points, which seemed Hebrew or
Syriac." This information comes from an old author,
and is a specimen of the absurd reports of the Christian
gospel having been preached at various points in
these regions, which are still believed to a considerable
extent by a certain class of the people of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_X-9" href="#Footnote_X-9" class="fnanchor">[X-9]</a></p>

<p>An author who wrote in 1778 states that between
Guadalajara and Sayula, and four leagues north-east
of the latter town, "there is a causeway of stone and
earth, about half a league long, across the narrowest
part of a marsh, or lagoon. There is a tradition that
the gentiles built it in ancient times. On most parts of
its shores this marsh has little heaps of pottery in
fragments, very wide and thick, and there can still be
found figures of large vessels, and also foundations and
traces of small houses of stone. Tradition relates
that the antiguos of different nations came here to
make salt, and that they had several bloody fights,
of which many traces appear in the shape of black
transparent flints worked into arrow-points."<a id="FNanchor_X-10" href="#Footnote_X-10" class="fnanchor">[X-10]</a></p>

<p>Mr Löwenstern discovered near Tepatitlan, some
fifty miles north-east of Guadalajara, a pyramid described
as somewhat similar to those of Teotihuacan,
but smaller, its exact dimensions not being given, but
the height being estimated at from ninety to a hundred
and thirty feet. It was built in three stories of
earth, sand, and pebbles, and bore on its summit a
dome-shaped mound. The pyramid at the base was
encased with large stones; whether or not they were
in hewn blocks is not stated, but the stones lying
about indicated that the whole surface had originally
borne a stone facing. The form of the base was
quadrangular, but time and the cultivation of the
whole surface as a cornfield, had modified the original
form and given the structure an octagonal conformation
with not very clearly defined angles. It requires
additional evidence to prove that this supposed pyramid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574">574</a></span>
was not a natural hill like Xochicalco with some
artificial improvement. The hill is called Cerrito de
Montezuma, the custom of applying this monarch's
name to every relic of antiquity being even more
common in the northern regions than in other parts of
the country. The author of <i>Cincinnatus' Travels</i>,
mentions a 'mound' at Zapotlan, about fifty miles
east of Guadalajara, which is five hundred feet high.
He does not expressly state that it is artificial, and a
gentleman familiar with the locality tells me that it
is not generally so regarded, having the appearance
of a natural grass-covered hill.<a id="FNanchor_X-11" href="#Footnote_X-11" class="fnanchor">[X-11]</a></p>

<p>In the northern part of the state, in the region of
Tepic, the Spaniards seem to have found grander temples,
a more elaborate religious system, and a civilization
generally somewhat more advanced than in
most other parts of the north or north-west. Still
no well-defined architectural monuments are reported
on good authority in modern times. It is to the
earlier writers that we must go for accounts of any
extensive remains, and such accounts in all cases
probably refer to the buildings which the Spaniards
found still in use among the natives; and the old
writers were ready to seize upon every scrap of rumor
in this direction, that they might successfully
trace the favorite southward course of the Aztecs
to Anáhuac. Hervas says that "there have been
found and still exist in Nayarit ruins of edifices
which by their form seem to be Mexican, and the
natives say that the Mexicans built them when they
were in Nayarit."<a id="FNanchor_X-12" href="#Footnote_X-12" class="fnanchor">[X-12]</a> This was another of the regions
where some wandering apostle preached the gospel in
aboriginal times, and the 'cross of Tepic' was one of the
celebrated Christian relics. Some wonderful foot-prints
in the stone are also among the reported relics.<a id="FNanchor_X-13" href="#Footnote_X-13" class="fnanchor">[X-13]</a> A
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">575</a></span>
temple of hewn stone, situated on a rocky hill, ascended
by a winding road, was found at Xuchipiltepetl
by the Spanish explorers in 1841; and Villa-Señor
describes a cave where the natives were wont
to worship the skeleton of an ancient king gaily
appareled and seated in state upon a throne.<a id="FNanchor_X-14" href="#Footnote_X-14" class="fnanchor">[X-14]</a> Finally
Prichard informs us that "near Nayarit are
seen earthen mounds and trenches."<a id="FNanchor_X-15" href="#Footnote_X-15" class="fnanchor">[X-15]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SANTIAGO IXCUINTLA.</p>

<p>A writer in the Boletin of the Mexican Geographical
Society describes the temple at Jalisco as it was
found by the first Spaniards; and another in the
<i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i> states that the village
of Jalisco, about a league from Tepic, is built on the
ruins of the ancient city, and that "in making excavations
there are found utensils of every kind, weapons
and idols of the Mexican divinities."<a id="FNanchor_X-16" href="#Footnote_X-16" class="fnanchor">[X-16]</a> After all,
the only definite account extant of relics found in
this part of the state is that by Sr Retes. He
says that the northern bank of the Rio Grande, or
Tololotlan, contains numerous remains for three or
four hundred miles, consisting chiefly of stone and
clay images and pottery, and occurring for the most
part on the elevated spots out of the reach of inundations.
The part of this region that has been most
explored, is the vicinity of Santiago Ixcuintla, twenty-five
or thirty miles from the mouth of the river.
On the slope of a hill four leagues north-west of
Santiago, at the foot of Lake San Juan, was found a
crocodile of natural size carved from stone, together
with several dogs or sphinxes, and some idols, which
the author deems similar to those of the Egyptians.
Human remains have been found in connection with
the other relics, and most of the latter are said to
have been sent to enrich European collections by rich
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">576</a></span>
foreign residents of Tepic. The objects consist of
idols in human and animal forms, axes, and lances,
the pottery being in many cases brightly colored.
The cut shows six of the thirty-eight relics pictured
in the plates given by Retes. Fig. 1, 2, are the
heads of small stone idols, the first head being only
two inches in height. Fig. 3 is a head of what the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577">577</a></span>
author calls a sphinx. Fig. 4 is an earthen-ware
mold for stamping designs on cloth or pottery; there
are several of these represented in the collection.
Fig. 5 is an earthen jar six inches high, of a material
nearly as hard as stone. Many of the jars found
are very similar to those now made and used in the
same region. Fig. 6 is an earthen idol four inches
high. Among the other objects is a flint lance-head
with notches like saw-teeth on the sides.<a id="FNanchor_X-17" href="#Footnote_X-17" class="fnanchor">[X-17]</a> Similar
relics, but of somewhat ruder style and coarser material,
have been found at a locality called Abrevadero,
about eighteen miles south of Santiago towards
Tepic.<a id="FNanchor_X-18" href="#Footnote_X-18" class="fnanchor">[X-18]</a> At Bolaños, some distance east from Santiago,
on a northern branch of the same river, Lyon
obtained, by offering rewards to the natives, "three
very good stone wedges or axes of basalt." Bones of
giants were reported at a distance of a day's journey.
At the same distance southward "there is said to be
a cave containing several figures or idols in stone."<a id="FNanchor_X-19" href="#Footnote_X-19" class="fnanchor">[X-19]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ANTIQUITIES OF GUANAJUATO.</p>

<p class="p2">Respecting the antiquities of Guanajuato Sr Bustamante
states that the only ones in the state are
some natural caves artificially improved, as in the
Cerro de San Gregorio, on the hacienda of Tupátaro;
and some earthen mounds in the plains of Bajio,
proved to be burial mounds. Under the earth and a
layer of ashes the skeleton lies with its head covered
by a little brazier of baked clay, and accompanied by
arrows, fragments of double-edged knives, obsidian
fragments, bird-bone necklaces strung on twisted
bird-gut, smooth stones, some small semi-spheres of
baked clay with a hole in the centre of each, and a
few grotesque idols.<a id="FNanchor_X-20" href="#Footnote_X-20" class="fnanchor">[X-20]</a></p>

<p>Castillo describes a small human head, brought
from the mines of Guanajuato, the material of which
was a "concretion of quartz and chalcedony for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578">578</a></span>
most part, sprinkled with fine grains of gold, and a
little pyrites, of a whitish color, but partly stained
red by the oxide of iron." This head, it seems, was
claimed by some to be a petrifaction, but the author
is of a contrary opinion, although he believes there
is nothing artificial about it except the mouth.<a id="FNanchor_X-21" href="#Footnote_X-21" class="fnanchor">[X-21]</a> Finally
Berlandier describes two pyramids near the
pueblo of Santa Catarina, in the vicinity of the city
of Guanajuato. They are square at the base, face the
cardinal points, and are built of pieces of porphyry
laid in clayey earth. The eastern pyramid is twenty-three
feet high, thirty-seven feet square at the base,
with a summit platform fifteen feet square. The corresponding
dimensions of the western mound are
eighteen, thirty-seven, and fifteen feet. They are only
fifteen or twenty feet apart, and are joined by an embankment
about five feet high.<a id="FNanchor_X-22" href="#Footnote_X-22" class="fnanchor">[X-22]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF QUEMADA.</p>

<p class="p2">The most important and famous ruins of the whole
northern region are those known to the world under
the name of Quemada, in southern Zacatecas. The
ruins are barely mentioned by the early writers as
one of the probable stations of the migrating Aztecs;
and the modern explorations which have resulted in
published descriptions were made between 1826 and
1831, although Manuel Gutierrez, parish priest of the
locality in 1805, wrote a slight account which has
been recently published.<a id="FNanchor_X-23" href="#Footnote_X-23" class="fnanchor">[X-23]</a> Capt. G. F. Lyon visited
Quemada in 1826, and published a full description,
illustrated with three small cuts, in his journal.<a id="FNanchor_X-24" href="#Footnote_X-24" class="fnanchor">[X-24]</a>
Gov. García of Zacatecas ordered Sr Esparza in 1830
to explore the ruins. The latter, however, by reason
of other duties and a fear of snakes, was not able to
make a personal visit, but obtained a report from Pedro
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">579</a></span>
Rivera who had made such a visit. The report
was published in the same year.<a id="FNanchor_X-25" href="#Footnote_X-25" class="fnanchor">[X-25]</a></p>

<p>Mr Berghes, a German mining engineer, connected
with the famous Veta Grande silver mines,
made a survey of the ruins in 1831, for Gov. García,
and from the survey prepared a detailed and presumably
accurate plan of the works, which was afterwards
published by Nebel, and which I shall copy in
this chapter. Mr Burkart, another engineer, was
the companion of Berghes, and also visited Quemada
on several other occasions. His published account
is accompanied by a plan agreeing very well
with that of Berghes, but containing fewer details.<a id="FNanchor_X-26" href="#Footnote_X-26" class="fnanchor">[X-26]</a>
Nebel visited Quemada about the same time.<a id="FNanchor_X-27" href="#Footnote_X-27" class="fnanchor">[X-27]</a> His
plates are two in number, a general view of the ruins
from the south-west, and an interior view of one of
the structures, besides Berghes' plan. His views,
so far as I know, are the only ones ever published.<a id="FNanchor_X-28" href="#Footnote_X-28" class="fnanchor">[X-28]</a></p>

<p>The location is about thirty miles southward of
the capital city of Zacatecas, and six miles northward
of Villanueva. The stream on which the
ruins stand is spoken of by Burkart as Rio de
Villanueva, and by Lyon as the Rio del Partido.
The name Quemada, 'burnt,' is that of a neighboring
hacienda, about a league distant towards
the south-west. I do not know the origin of the
name as applied to the hacienda, but there is no evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580">580</a></span>
that it has any connection with the ruins.
The local name of the latter is Los Edificios. The
only other name which I have found applied to the
place is Tuitlan. Fr Tello, in an unpublished history
of Nueva Galicia written about 1650, tells us that
the Spaniards under Capt. Chirinos "found a great
city in ruins and abandoned; but it was known to
have had most sumptuous edifices, with grand streets
and plazas well arranged, and within a distance of a
quarter of a league four towers, with causeways of
stone leading from one to another; and this city was
the great Tuitlan, where the Mexican Indians remained
many years when they were journeying from
the north."<a id="FNanchor_X-29" href="#Footnote_X-29" class="fnanchor">[X-29]</a> This ruined city was in the region of
the modern town of Jerez, and without much
doubt was identical with Quemada. Sr Gil applies
the same name to the ruins. Others without any
known authority attempt to identify Quemada with
Chicomoztoc, 'the seven caves' whence the Aztecs
set out on their migrations; or with Amaquemecan,
the ancient Chichimec capital of the traditions. Gil
rather extravagantly says, "these ruins are the
grandest which exist among us after those of Palenque;
and on examining them, it is seen that they
were the fruit of a civilization more advanced than
that which was found in Peru at the time of the
Incas, or in Mexico at the time of Montezuma."<a id="FNanchor_X-30" href="#Footnote_X-30" class="fnanchor">[X-30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">LOS EDIFICIOS OF QUEMADA.</p>

<p class="p2">The Cerro de los Edificios is a long narrow isolated
hill, the summit of which forms an irregular broken
plateau over half a mile in length from north to south,
and from one hundred to two hundred yards wide, except
at the northern end, where it widens to about
five hundred yards. The height of the hill is given
by Lyon as from two to three hundred feet, but by
Burkart at eight to nine hundred feet above the level
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581">581</a></span>
of the plain. In the central part is a cliff rising about
thirty feet above the rest of the plateau. From the
brow the hill descends more or less precipitously on
different sides for about a hundred and fifty feet, and
then stretches in a gentler slope of from two to four
hundred yards to the surrounding plain. On the slope
and skirting the whole circumference of the hill, except
on the north and north-east, are traces of ancient
roads crossing each other at different angles, and connected
by cross roads running up the slope with the
works on the summit. Berghes' plan of Quemada
is given on the following page, on which the roads
spoken of are indicated by the dotted lines marked
H, H, H, etc. This plan and Burkart's plan and description
are the only authorities for the existence of
the roads running round the hill, Lyon and other visitors
speaking only of those that diverge from it; but
it is probable that Berghes' survey was more careful
and thorough than that of the others, and his plan
should be accepted as good authority, especially as the
other accounts agree with it so far as they go.<a id="FNanchor_X-31" href="#Footnote_X-31" class="fnanchor">[X-31]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i582"></a>

<p class="caption">Plan of the Ruins at Quemada.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="images/i582-l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>One of the roads, which turns at a right angle
round the south-western slope, has traces of having
been enclosed or raised by walls whose foundations
yet remain; and from it at a point near the angle a
raised causeway ninety-three feet wide extends straight
up the slope north-eastward to the foot of the bluff.
The walls supposed to have raised those south-western
roads are not spoken of by Burkart or shown on his
plan; Lyon speaks of certain walls here which he
considers those of an enclosed area of some six acres.
From a point near the junction of the road and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582">582</a></span>
causeway three raised roads, paved with rough stones
extend, according to Lyon, in perfectly straight lines
S.W., S.S.W., and S.W. by S. The first terminates
in an artificial mound across the river towards
the hacienda of Quemada;<a id="FNanchor_X-32" href="#Footnote_X-32" class="fnanchor">[X-32]</a> the second extends four
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583">583</a></span>
miles to the Coyote Rancho; and the third is said
by the natives to terminate at a mountain six miles
distant. Two similar roads thirteen or fourteen feet
wide extend from the eastern slope of the hill, one
of them crossing a stream and terminating at a distance
of two miles in a cuicillo, or heap of stones.
Burkart found some evidence that the heap constituted
the ruins of a regular structure or pyramid; and Rivera
locates the cuicillo on the summit of the Sierra
de Palomas. He also speaks of a road running west
from the north-western part of the hill to the small
hills of San Juan, on the Zacatecas road. Of the
other roads radiating from the hill I have no farther
information than the fact that they are laid down in
the plan.<a id="FNanchor_X-33" href="#Footnote_X-33" class="fnanchor">[X-33]</a></p>

<p>At all points in the whole circumference where the
natural condition of the slope is not in itself a sufficient
barrier to those seeking access to the summit
plateau, the brow of the hill is guarded by walls of
stone, marked B on the plan for the northern portions,
and indicated generally by the black lines in
the south. Indeed the northern end of the mesa,
where the approach is somewhat less precipitous than
elsewhere, is continuously guarded by such a wall,
from nine to twelve feet thick and high, enclosing an
irregular triangular area with sides of about four hundred
and fifty yards: this area being divided by
another wall into two unequal portions.</p>

<p>The most numerous and extensive ruins are on the
southern portion of the hill, where a larger part of
the uneven surface is formed into platforms or terraces
by means of walls of solid masonry. One of
these supporting walls is double&mdash;that is, composed of
two walls placed in contact side by side, one having
been completed and plastered before the other was
begun, the whole structure being twenty-one feet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">584</a></span>
high and of the same thickness.<a id="FNanchor_X-34" href="#Footnote_X-34" class="fnanchor">[X-34]</a> On the platforms
thus formed are a great number of edifices in different
degrees of dilapidation. Any attempt on my part to
describe these edifices in detail from the information
afforded by the authorities available could not be
otherwise than confusing and unsatisfactory. There
is probably no ruin in our territory, the verbal description
of which would present so great difficulties, even
if the accounts of the original explorers were perfectly
comprehensive, as they are not; for perhaps
more than three fourths of the structures shown on
the plan are not definitely spoken of by any author.
I will, however, give as clear a description as possible,
referring the reader to the plan and to one view
which I shall copy, the only satisfactory one ever published.</p>

<p>Near each end of the wide causeway already mentioned
are two comparatively small masses of ruins.
One of them appears to have been a square stone
building thirty-one feet square at the base and of the
same height; the others, now completely in ruins,
may perhaps have been of similar dimensions, so far
as may be judged by the débris. In the centre of
the causeway, perhaps at F of the plan, although described
as nearer the bluff, is a heap of stone over a
star-shaped border or pavement. On the lower part
of the mesa, at the extreme southern end and also
near the head of the causeway, at A iv of the plan,
is a quadrangular space measuring two hundred by
two hundred and forty feet,<a id="FNanchor_X-35" href="#Footnote_X-35" class="fnanchor">[X-35]</a> and bounded, at least on
the north and east, by a stone terrace or embankment
four or five feet high and twenty feet wide, the width
of which is probably to be included in the dimensions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585">585</a></span>
given.<a id="FNanchor_X-36" href="#Footnote_X-36" class="fnanchor">[X-36]</a> Mr Burkart states that near the inner
edge of this terrace is a canal a foot deep and wide,
covered with stone flags. On the outer edge of the
terrace, on the eastern side, stands a wall eight feet
thick and eighteen feet high. Mr Lyon thinks the
other sides were always open, but Burkart speaks of
the wall as having originally enclosed the square, and
having been torn down on three sides, which seems
much more probable. At one point on the eastern
terrace stands a round pillar nineteen feet in circumference
and of the same height as the wall, or eighteen
feet. There are visible traces of nine other similar
pillars, seemingly indicating the former presence of a
massive column-supported portico.</p>

<p>Adjoining this enclosure on the east, with only a
narrow passage intervening, is another, R of the
plan, measuring according to Burkart's measurement,
which agrees very nearly with that of Berghes,
one hundred by one hundred and thirty-eight
feet,<a id="FNanchor_X-37" href="#Footnote_X-37" class="fnanchor">[X-37]</a> with walls still perfect, eighteen feet high
and eight feet thick, in connection with which no
terraces are mentioned, although Rivera speaks of
steps on the west. Within the walls, twenty-three
feet from the sides and nineteen and a half from the
ends, is a line of eleven pillars&mdash;Lyon says fourteen,
and Rivera ten&mdash;each seventeen feet in circumference
and of the same height as the walls. There can be
little doubt that these columns once sustained a roof.
Mr Berghes in one of his excavations in 1831 is
said, by Nebel, to have found an ancient roof supported
by a column, and showing exactly the method
followed by the builders. The roof was made of
large flat stones, covered with mortar and supported
by beams. It is not quite clear how an excavation
on the hill could show such a room, but there is little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586">586</a></span>
room to doubt that the roof-structure was similar to
that described. Near this second enclosure&mdash;and
west of it, as is said, but that would be hardly possible&mdash;Rivera
speaks of a circular ruin sixteen and a
half feet in diameter, with five steps leading up to
the summit, on which some apartments were still
traceable.</p>

<p>From the level platform in front of the two main
structures described, a causeway, beginning with a
stairway and guarded at the sides by walls for much
of its length, leads northward up the slope. About
three hundred yards in this direction, possibly at the
point marked F on this causeway, is a pyramid in
perfect preservation, about fifty feet square at the
base, also fifty feet high, with a flat summit. Near
this is another pyramid, only twelve feet square and
eighteen feet high, but standing on a terrace fifty by
one hundred feet. Two bowl-shaped circular pits,
eight feet in diameter, with fragments of pottery and
traces of fire; a square building ten by eight feet
on the inside, with walls ten feet high; and a simple
mound of stones eight feet high, are the miscellaneous
remains noted in this part of the hill.</p>

<p>The most extensive and complicated ruins are
found between the steep central height and the western
brow of the hill, where there is a perpendicular
descent of a hundred and fifty feet. On this central
height itself there are no ruins, but passing nearly
round its base are terraced roads twenty-five feet
wide, with perpendicular walls only partially artificial.
Of the extensive group of monuments on the platform
of the south-western base of the central height, only
the portion about A ii, of the plan, has been definitely
described, and the description, although clear
enough in itself, does not altogether agree with the
plan. Here we have a square enclosure similar to
the one already described in the south at A iv. Its
sides are one hundred and fifty feet, bounded by a
terrace three feet high and twelve feet wide, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587">587</a></span>
steps in the centre of each side. Back of the terrace
on the east, west, and south sides stand walls
eight or nine feet in thickness and twenty feet high.
The north side of the square is bounded by the steep
side of the central cliff, in which steps or seats are
cut in some parts in the solid rock, and in others
built up with rough stones. In the centre of this
side, and partially on the terrace, is a truncated pyramid,
with a base of thirty-eight by thirty-five feet,
and nineteen feet high, divided into several stories&mdash;five
according to Nebel's drawing, seven according to
Lyon's statement.<a id="FNanchor_X-38" href="#Footnote_X-38" class="fnanchor">[X-38]</a></p>

<p>In front of the pyramid, and nearly in the centre
of the square, stands a kind of altar or small pyramid
seven feet square and five feet high. A very
clear idea of this square is given in the following cut
from Nebel's drawing. It presents an interior view
from a point on the southern terrace. The pyramid
in five stories, the central altar, the eastern terrace
with its steps, and standing portions of the walls are
all clearly portrayed. The view, however, disagrees
very essentially with the plan in representing extensive
remains northward from the enclosure on the
upper slope, where, according to Berghes' plan, no
ruins exist. There is an entrance in the centre of the
eastern wall, another in the western, and two on the
south. These entrances do not seem to be in the
form of doorways, but extend, according to the drawing,
to the full height of the walls. That on the
east is thirty feet wide and leads to an adjoining
square with sides of two hundred feet and walls still
perfect. The arrangement of these two adjoining
squares is much like that of those at A iv in the
south, but in the northern structures there are no pillars
to be seen.</p>

<img src="images/i588.jpg" width="550" height="362" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Interior of Los Edificios.</p>
</div>

<p>The opening through the western wall leads to the
entrance to a cave, reported to be of great extent, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588">588</a></span>
not explored by any visitor on account of the ruined
condition of the passage leading to it&mdash;or, as Gutierrez
says, because the wind issues constantly from the entrance
with such force that no one can enter with
lights. The mouth of the subterranean passage is on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589">589</a></span>
the brink of the western precipice; the walls were
plastered, and the top supported by cedar beams.
Strangely enough the structure at A iii, so clearly
defined on the plan, is not described at all. It seems
to be very similar to the enclosures described.</p>

<p>The ruins on the northern part of the plateau are
similar in character to those in the south, but fewer
in number. Among them are square terraced enclosures
like those already mentioned; a pyramid
with sloping sides, and eighteen feet square at the
summit; a square building sixteen feet square at
the base and sixteen feet high; and two parallel
stone mounds thirty feet long.</p>

<p>On the lower southern slopes the foundation-stones
of numerous buildings are found, and many parts of
the adjoining plain are strewn with stones similar to
those employed in the construction of the edifices
above. There is now no water on the hill, but there
are several tolerably perfect tanks, with a well, and
what seem to be the remains of aqueducts.</p>

<p>The material of which all the works described are
built is the gray porphyry of this and the neighboring
hills, and Burkart states that the building-stone
of Los Edificios was not quarried in the hill on
which they stand, but brought from another across
the valley. The nature of the stone permits it to be
very easily fractured into slabs, and those employed
in the buildings are of different sizes, but rarely exceeding
two or three inches in thickness and not
hewn. They are laid in a mortar of reddish clay
mixed with straw, in which one visitor found a corn-husk.
The mortar, according to Burkart, is of an
inferior quality,&mdash;although others represent it as very
good&mdash;and on the outer walls and in all exposed situations
is almost entirely washed out. Except this
washing-out of the mortar, time and the elements
have committed but slight ravages at Quemada, the
dilapidation of the buildings being due for the most
part to man's agency, since most of the buildings of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590">590</a></span>
the neighboring hacienda have been constructed of
blocks taken from Los Edificios. Lyon found some
evidence that the walls were originally plastered and
whitened.</p>

<p>A large circular stone from ten to thirteen feet in
diameter and from one to three in thickness, according
to different observers, on the surface of which were
sculptured representations of a hand and foot, was
found at the western base of the hill, or as Burkart
says, at the eastern base. The editor of the <i>Museo
Mexicano</i> also speaks of a sculptured turtle bearing
the figure of a reed, the Aztec <i>acatl</i>. No other miscellaneous
relics whatever have been found. Nothing
resembling inscriptions, hieroglyphics, or even architectural
decorations, is found in any part of the ruins.
Obsidian fragments, arrow and spear heads, knives,
ornaments, heads and idols of terra cotta and stone,
pottery whole or in fragments, human remains and
burial deposits, some or all of which are strewn in so
great abundance in the vicinity of most other American
ruins, are here utterly wanting; or at least the
only exceptions are a few bits of porphyry somewhat
resembling arrow-heads, and some small bits of pottery
found by Lyon in the circular pit on the summit.</p>

<p class="p2">The works which have been described naturally
imply the existence in this spot at some time in the
past of a great city of the plain, of which the Cerro
de los Edificios was at once the fortified citadel and
temple. The paved causeways may be regarded as
the principal streets of the ancient city, on which the
habitations of the people were built of perishable
material, or as constructed for some purely religious
purpose not now understood. Mr Burkart suggests
that the land in the vicinity was once swampy, and
the causeways were raised to ensure a dry road. An
examination of their foundation should settle that
point, as a simple pavement of flat stones on the
surface of a marsh would not remain permanently in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591">591</a></span>
place. As simple roads, such structures were hardly
needed by barefooted or sandaled natives, having no
carriages or beasts of burden; and it seems most
reasonable to believe that they had a connection with
religious rites and processions, serving at the same
time as main streets of a city.</p>

<p>The ruins of Quemada show but few analogies to
any of the southern remains, and none whatever to
any that we shall find further north. As a strongly
fortified hill, bearing also temples, Quemada bears
considerable resemblance to Quiotepec in Oajaca;
and possibly the likeness would be still stronger if a
plan of the Quiotepec fortifications were extant.
The massive character, number, and extent of the
monuments show the builders to have been a powerful
and in some respects an advanced people, hardly
less so, it would seem at first thought, than the peoples
of Central America; but the absence of narrow
buildings covered by arches of overlapping stones,
and of all decorative sculpture and painting, make
the contrast very striking. The pyramids, so far as
they are described, do not differ very materially from
some in other parts of the country, but the location
of the pyramids shown in the drawing and plan
within the enclosed and terraced squares seems
unique. The pillars recall the roof structures of
Mitla, but it is quite possible that the pillars at
Quemada supported balconies instead of roofs; indeed,
it seems improbable that these large squares
were ever entirely covered. The walls of Los Edificios
are higher as a rule than those of other American
ruins, and the absence of windows and regular
doorways is noticeable. The total want of idols in
structures so evidently built, at least partially, for
religious purposes, is also a remarkable feature, as is
the absence of the usual pottery, implements, and
weapons. The peculiar structure, several times repeated,
of two adjoining quadrangular spaces enclosed,
or partially so, by high walls, and one of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">592</a></span>
them formed by a low terrace into a kind of square
basin, containing something like an altar in its centre,
is a feature not elsewhere noted. There can
hardly be any doubt that these and other portions of
the Edificios were devoted to religious rites.</p>

<p>While Quemada does not compare as a specimen
of advanced art with Uxmal and Palenque, and is
inferior so far as sculpture and decoration are concerned
to most other Nahua architectural monuments,
it is yet one of the most remarkable of
American ruins, presenting strong contrasts to all
the rest, and is well worthy of a more careful examination
than it has ever yet received. Such an
examination is rendered comparatively easy by the
accessibility of the locality, and would, I have no
doubt, be far from unprofitable in an antiquarian
point of view. Los Edificios, like Copan and Palenque,
have, so far as has yet been ascertained, no
place in the traditional annals of the country, yet
they bear no marks of very great antiquity; that is,
there is more reason to class them with Xochicalco,
Quiotepec, Monte Alban, and the fortified towns of
Vera Cruz, than with the cities of Yucatan and
Chiapas, or even the pyramids of Teotihuacan and
Cholula.</p>

<p class="p2">At San Juan Teul, nearly a hundred miles southward
from Quemada, the Spaniards found a grand
aboriginal temple when they first came to this part of
the country; and Frejes, an early writer, says, "there
are ruins of a temple and of dwellings not far from
the present pueblo." There is, however, no later
information respecting this group of remains. At a
place called Tabasco, about fifty miles from Quemada,
Esparza mentions the discovery of some stone axes.
No other antiquities have been definitely reported in
the state of Zacatecas, although Arlegui tells us that
the early missionaries were much troubled, and hindered
in their work of conversion by the constant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593">593</a></span>
discovery of idols and temples concealed in the
mountains.<a id="FNanchor_X-39" href="#Footnote_X-39" class="fnanchor">[X-39]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">AGUASCALIENTES AND SAN LUIS POTOSÍ.</p>

<p class="p2">I have no record of any relics of antiquity in the
state of Aguascalientes: San Luis Potosí has hardly
proved a more fruitful field of archæological research.
Mayer gives a cut representing a stone axe from this
state; Cabrera reports some ancient tombs, or cuicillos,&mdash;which
he calls <i>cuiztillos</i>; the word being written
differently by different authors, and as applied to different
states&mdash;in the suburbs of the city of San Luis
Potosí; and according to a newspaper report two idols
and a sacrificial basin, cut from a concrete sandstone,
were found in the sierra near the city and brought to
New Orleans. One of the idols was of life size, had
two faces and a hole for the insertion of a torch in its
right hand; the basin was two feet in diameter, and
held by intertwined serpents.<a id="FNanchor_X-40" href="#Footnote_X-40" class="fnanchor">[X-40]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In southern Tamaulipas relics are quite abundant
and of a nature very much the same as that of those
which have already been described south of the Rio
Pánuco, the boundary line between Tamaulipas and
Vera Cruz. At Encarnacion, in the vicinity of Tampico,
Mr Furber reports the stone idol shown in front
and profile view in the cut. The sculpture is described
as rude, and with the idol, three feet high, were dug
up several implements and utensils.<a id="FNanchor_X-41" href="#Footnote_X-41" class="fnanchor">[X-41]</a> Near a small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594">594</a></span>
salt lake between Tula and Santa Barbara, Mr Lyon
found a ruined pyramidal mound of hard earth or
clay, faced with flat unhewn stones, with similar
stones projecting and forming steps leading up the
slope on one side. This pyramid is thirty paces in
circumference at the base, and is divided by a terrace
into two stories, the lower of which is twenty feet
high, and the upper in its present state ten feet.
Some stone and terra-cotta images have been taken
from this mound, and another much smaller but similar
structure is reported to exist somewhere in the
same vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_X-42" href="#Footnote_X-42" class="fnanchor">[X-42]</a></p>

<p>On the Tamissee River, which flows into Tampico
Bay, traces of ancient towns have been found in two
localities near the Carmelote Creek. They consist of
scattered hewn blocks of stone, covered with vegetable
mold and overgrown with immense trees and rank
vegetation. At one of these localities the remains
include seventeen large earthen mounds, with traces
of a layer of mortar at the bottom. In them have
been found broken pottery, rudely carved images of
natural size in sandstone, and idols and heads in terra
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595">595</a></span>
cotta. Mr Norman gives cuts representing two of
these heads.<a id="FNanchor_X-43" href="#Footnote_X-43" class="fnanchor">[X-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TOPILA REMAINS.</p>

<p>In the south-western part of the state, in the Topila
hills, near a creek of the same name, is a large
group of remains at a locality known as Rancho de
las Piedras. Mr Norman, who spent a week in their
examination, is the only authority for these remains,
and as he was obliged to work alone and unaided, his
examination was necessarily superficial. Over an area
several miles square the ground is strewn with hewn
blocks of stone and fragments of pottery and obsidian.
Many of the blocks bear decorative sculptured figures.
A female face carved from a block of fine dark
reddish sandstone, was brought away by Mr Norman
and presented to the New York Historical Society.
It is shown in the cut. The face is of life size, very
symmetrical in its form, and of a Grecian type.
Another monument sketched by the explorer was a
stone turtle, six feet long, with a human head. The
sculpture, especially of the turtle's shell, is described
as very fine; the whole rests on a large block of concrete
sandstone, and is called by the finder the American
Sphinx. This relic was somewhat damaged, but
the features of the human face seemed of a Caucasian
rather than a native type.</p>

<p class="caption">Colossal Head&mdash;Topila Ruins.</p>
</div>

<p>The Topila ruins include twenty mounds, both circular
and square, from six to twenty-five feet in
height, built of earth and faced with uniform blocks
of sandstone, eighteen inches square and six inches
thick. The facings had for the most part fallen, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596">596</a></span>
that invariably inward in the smaller mounds, indicating
perhaps their original use as tombs. Many of
the blocks are scattered through the forest in places
where the mounds had entirely disappeared. Of all
the mounds only one has any trace of a terrace, and
in that one it is very faint; and there is no evidence
that mortar was employed in laying the stones. The
largest covered about two acres, and bore on its summit
a wild fig-tree one hundred feet high. At its
base is a circular wall of stone, the top of which is
even with the surface of the ground&mdash;perhaps a well&mdash;and
which is filled with stones and broken pottery.
Its top is covered with a circular stone four feet and
nine inches in diameter and seven inches thick, with
a hole in its centre and some ornamental lines sculptured
on its upper surface. Another round stone,
twelve feet in diameter and three feet thick, on the
front of which is carved a colossal human head, is
shown in the cut. The author speaks vaguely of
"vast piles of broken and crumbling stones, the ruins
of dilapidated buildings, which were strewed over a
vast space;" and his cuts of the relics which I have
copied show in the background, not included in my
copies, regular walls of hewn stone. Mr Norman regards
this group as the remains of a great city, the
site of which is now covered by a heavy forest. In
another locality, seven miles further north-west on
the Topila Creek, and a few miles from the Pánuco
River, is another group of circular mounds, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597">597</a></span>
them twenty-five feet high, and the lower portions
faced with flat hewn stones. Hewn blocks of various
forms and sizes are also scattered about the locality,
but none of them are sculptured.<a id="FNanchor_X-44" href="#Footnote_X-44" class="fnanchor">[X-44]</a> Lyon tells us
that "remains of utensils, statues, weapons, and even
skeletons," have been often found in digging for the
foundations of new buildings in the vicinity of Tampico,
or Tamaulipas. He made drawings, which he
did not publish, of two very perfect basalt idols, and
mentioned also some bone carvings and terra-cotta
idols found in this region.<a id="FNanchor_X-45" href="#Footnote_X-45" class="fnanchor">[X-45]</a> In northern Tamaulipas
I find only one mention of aboriginal monuments,
and that at Burrita, about twenty miles east from
Matamoras, respecting which locality Berlandier says,
"on a small hill which is seen two or three hundred
paces from the rancho of Burrita are found in abundance
(as the rancheros say) the bones of ancient
peoples."<a id="FNanchor_X-46" href="#Footnote_X-46" class="fnanchor">[X-46]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BOLSON DE MAPIMI.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BURIAL CAVES.</p>

<p>Nuevo Leon, adjoining Tamaulipas on the west,
is another of the states within whose limits no antiquities
have been reported; and in Texas on the
north almost the same absence of aboriginal remains
is to be remarked, although one group of rock-inscriptions
will be noted in a future chapter at Rocky
Dell creek, in the north-western part of the state
bordering on New Mexico. In the region bordering
on the valley known as the Bolson de Mapimi, comprising
parts of the states of Coahuila, Durango, and
Chihuahua, the natives at some time in the past seem
to have deposited their dead in natural caves, and several
of these burial deposits of great extent have
been discovered and reported. None of them are
accurately located by any traveler or writer, nor is it
possible to tell in which of the three states any one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598">598</a></span>
of them should be described. As antiquities, however,
these burial caves do not require a long notice.
The one of which most has been written is that discovered
by Juan Flores in 1838. The entrance to
the cave was at the foot of a hill, and within were
seated round the walls over a thousand mummies
"dressed in fine blankets, made of the fibres of lechuguilla,
with sandals, made of a species of liana, on
their feet, and ornamented with colored scarfs, with
beads of seeds of fruits, polished bones, &amp;c.," as Wizlizenus
says. Mühlenpfordt tells us that Flores to
find this cave traveled eastward from the Rancho San
Juan de Casta, which is eighty-six leagues northward
from Durango. Another traveler heard of several of
these caves, and that the remains found were of gigantic
size. Mayer gives a report that in latitude
27° 28´ there are a multitude of caverns excavated
from solid rock, bearing inscribed figures of animals
and men, the latter dressed like the ancient Mexicans.
Some of them were described by Fr Rotéa as
fifteen by thirty feet, and identical probably with
Chicomoztoc, the famous 'seven caves.' A writer in
<i>Silliman's Journal</i>, referring perhaps to the same
cave, extends the number of mummies from a thousand
to millions, and speaks of necklaces of marine
shells. Mr Wilson locates one of these mummy-deposits
on the western slope of a high mountain overlooking
the ancient pueblo of Chiricahui, in Chihuahua
probably. Several rows of bodies, dried and
shrunken but not decayed, were exposed by an excavation
for saltpetre. Each body sewn up in a strong
well-woven cloth, and covered again with sewn palm-leaves,
lay on its back on two sticks, with knees
drawn up to chin, and feet toward the mouth of the
cavern. The cave was a hundred feet in circumference
and thirty or forty feet high, and the bottom for
a depth of twenty feet, at least, was composed of alternate
layers of bodies, and of earth and pebbles.
The preservation is thought to be attributable to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599">599</a></span>
dryness of the air and the presence of saltpetre.
Parts of the mummies, of the wrapping-cloths, bone
beads and beads of blue stone, with parts of a belt
and tassels, were presented to the California Academy
of Natural Sciences in July, 1864. Sr Avila describes
two of these caves situated in the vicinity of
San Lorenzo, about thirty-five leagues west of Parras,
in Coahuila. One had to be entered from the
top by means of ropes, and the other had some of its
rocks artificially cut and painted. In both of these
deposits bones were found instead of mummies, but
they were as in the other cases wrapped in cloth and
gaily decked with beads, sticks, and tassels. Hair
was found on some of the heads, and a white hand
was noticed frequently painted on the walls. Padre
Alegre speaks of the existence of caves in this region,
with human remains, and painted characters on the
cliffs. Respecting the latter, Padre Ribas says "the
cliffs of that hill and of the caves were marked with
characters and a kind of letters, formed with blood,
and in some places so high that nobody but the devil
could have put them there, and so permanent that
neither the rains nor winds had erased or diminished
them."<a id="FNanchor_X-47" href="#Footnote_X-47" class="fnanchor">[X-47]</a></p>

<p>Besides the burial caves, the only account I find
of any antiquities in the state of Coahuila, is contained
in the following quotation, of rather doubtful
authenticity, perhaps, respecting some remains on the
hacienda of San Martero, about twenty-six miles
from Monclova. "The spot bears every appearance
of having once been a populous city. Stone foundations
are to be seen, covering many acres. Innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600">600</a></span>
columns and walls rise up in every direction,
composed of both limestone and sandstone. The columns
are built in a variety of shapes, some round,
others square, and bear every imprint of the work of
human hands.... For miles in the vicinity, the basin
is covered with broken pottery of burnt clay, fantastically
painted and ornamented with a variety of inexplicable
designs."<a id="FNanchor_X-48" href="#Footnote_X-48" class="fnanchor">[X-48]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS IN LA BREÑA.</p>

<p class="p2">In Durango, besides the sepulchral deposits alluded
to, Ribas in his standard and very rare work
on the 'triumphs of the faith' in the northern regions,
mentions the existence of idols, columns, and the
ruins of habitations at Zape, in the central part of
the state; and Larios tells us that in the vicinity
of the church which was being built in his time,
there were found at every step burial vases, containing
ashes and human bones, stones of various
colors, and, most wonderful of all, statues or images
of men and animals, one resembling a priest.<a id="FNanchor_X-49" href="#Footnote_X-49" class="fnanchor">[X-49]</a> At
San Agustin, between the city of Durango and San
Juan del Rio, Arlegui notes the existence of some
bones of giants. The good padre did not rely in
making his statement on mere reports, but saw
with his own eyes a jaw-tooth which measured over
eight inches square, and belonged to a jaw which
must, according to his calculations, have measured
nine feet and a half in the semicircle.<a id="FNanchor_X-50" href="#Footnote_X-50" class="fnanchor">[X-50]</a> In the volcanic
region extending south-eastward from the city
of Durango, known as La Breña, there are large
numbers of very curious natural caves, the bottoms
of which are covered with a thick layer of fine dust,
containing much saltpetre. In this dust, Sr José
Fernando Ramirez discovered various antiquarian
relics, which he deposited in the National Museum
of Mexico. The only one specially mentioned was a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601">601</a></span>
very small stone turtle, not over half an inch in diameter,
very perfectly carved from a hard material.
The region of La Breña has always been a land of
mystery popularly supposed to contain immense concealed
treasure, the localities of the deposits being
marked by small heaps of stones which occurred
frequently in out-of-the-way places not covered by
the torrent of lava. Most of these stone heaps, perhaps
altars or burial places of the ancient inhabitants,
have been destroyed by the treasure-seekers, always
without yielding the sought-for deposits of gold or
silver. The only other relics of aboriginal times in
La Breña are certain small cup-shaped excavations
in the living rock, supposed to have been used
originally for offerings to the deities worshiped by
the natives.<a id="FNanchor_X-51" href="#Footnote_X-51" class="fnanchor">[X-51]</a></p>

<p class="p2">I find no record of any ancient monuments in
Sinaloa, and across the gulf in the state of Lower
California, with the exception of some idols, said to
have been brought to the priests by the natives they
were attempting to convert, and a smooth stone about
six feet long, bearing a kind of coat of arms and
some inscribed characters,<a id="FNanchor_X-52" href="#Footnote_X-52" class="fnanchor">[X-52]</a> the only accounts of antiquities
relate to cave and cliff paintings and inscriptions,
which have never been copied, and concerning
which consequently not much can be said. Clavigero
says that the Jesuits found, between latitude 27° and
28°, "several great caves excavated in living rock,
and painted with figures of men and women decently
clad, and of several kinds of animals. These pictures,
though rude, represented distinctly the objects.
The colors employed in them were obtained, as may
be plainly seen, from the mineral earths which are
found about the volcano of Virgenes." The paintings
were not the work of the natives found in possession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602">602</a></span>
of the country, at least so the Spaniards decided, and
it was considered remarkable that they had remained
through so many centuries fresh and uninjured by
time. The colors were yellow, red, green, and black,
and many designs were placed so high on cliffs that
it seemed necessary to some of the missionaries to
suppose the agency of the giants that were in 'those
days.' Indeed, giants' bones were found on the
peninsula, as in all other parts of the country, and
the natives are said to have had a tradition that the
paintings were the work of giants who came from
the north. Clavigero mentions one cave whose walls
and roof formed an arch resting on the floor. It was
about fifteen by eighty feet, and the pictures on its
walls represented men and women dressed like Mexicans,
but barefooted. The men had their arms raised
and spread apart, and one woman wore her hair loose
and flowing down her back, and also had a plume.
Some animals were noted both native and foreign.
One author says they bore no resemblance to Mexican
paintings. A series of red hands are reported on
a cliff near Santiago mission in the south, and also,
towards the sea, some painted fishes, bows, arrows,
and obscure characters. A rock-inscription near
Purmo, thirty leagues from Santiago, seemed to the
Spanish observer to contain Gothic, Hebrew, and
Chaldean letters. From all that is known of the
Lower California rock-paintings and inscriptions,
there is no reason to suppose that they differ much
from, or at least are superior to, those in the New
Mexican region, of which we shall find so many specimens
in the next chapter. It is not improbable that
these ruder inscriptions and pictures exist in the
southern country already passed over, to a much
greater extent than appears in the preceding pages,
but have remained comparatively unnoticed by travelers
in search of more wonderful or perfect relics of
antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_X-53" href="#Footnote_X-53" class="fnanchor">[X-53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603">603</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CERRO DE LAS TRINCHERAS.</p>

<p>Only one monument is known in Sonora, and that
only through newspaper reports. It is known as the
Cerro de las Trincheras, and is situated about fifty
miles south-east of Altar. An isolated conical hill
has a spring of water on its summit, also some heaps
of loose stones. The sides of the cerro are encircled
by fifty or sixty walls of rough stones; each about
nine feet high and from three to six feet thick, occurring
at irregular intervals of fifty to a hundred feet.
Each wall, except that at the base of the hill, has a
gateway, but these entrances occur alternately on opposite
sides of the hill, so that to reach the summit
an enemy would have to fight his way about twenty-five
times round the circumference. One writer tells
us that Las Trincheras were first found&mdash;probably
by the Spaniards&mdash;in 1650; according to another, the
natives say that the fortifications existed in their
present state long before the Spaniards came; and
finally Sr C. M. Galan, ex-governor of Sinaloa and
Lower California, a gentleman well acquainted with
all the north-western region, informs me that there is
much doubt among the inhabitants of the locality
whether the walls have not been built since the Spanish
Conquest. Sonora also furnished its quota of
giants' bones.<a id="FNanchor_X-54" href="#Footnote_X-54" class="fnanchor">[X-54]</a></p>

<p class="p2">There are three or four localities in the state of
Chihuahua where miscellaneous remains are vaguely
mentioned in addition to the burial caves already referred
to in the extreme south-east. Hardy reports
a cave near the presidio of San Buenaventura, from
which saltpetre is taken for the manufacture of powder,
and in which some arrows have been found, with
some curious shoes intended for the hoof of an animal,
arranged to be tied on heel in front, with a
view of misleading pursuers. The cave is very large,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604">604</a></span>
and the natives have a tradition of a subterranean
passage leading northward to the Casas Grandes,
over twenty miles.<a id="FNanchor_X-55" href="#Footnote_X-55" class="fnanchor">[X-55]</a> Lamberg mentions the existence
of some remains at Corralitos, and announces
his intention to explore them.<a id="FNanchor_X-56" href="#Footnote_X-56" class="fnanchor">[X-56]</a> García Conde says
that ancient works are found at various points in the
state, specifying, however, only one of them, which
consists of a spiral parapet wall encircling the sides
of a hill from top to bottom, near the cañon of Bachimba.<a id="FNanchor_X-57" href="#Footnote_X-57" class="fnanchor">[X-57]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CASAS GRANDES OF CHIHUAHUA.</p>

<p class="p2">One celebrated group of ruins remains to be described
in this chapter&mdash;the Casas Grandes of northern
Chihuahua. These ruins are situated on the
Casas Grandes River,&mdash;which, flowing northward,
empties into a lake near the United States boundary,&mdash;about
midway between the towns of Janos and Galeana,
and one hundred and fifty miles north-west of
the city of Chihuahua. They are frequently mentioned
by the early writers as a probable station of
the migrating Aztecs, but these early accounts are
more than usually inaccurate in this case. Robertson
found in a manuscript work a mention of the
Casas Grandes as "the remains of a paltry building
of turf and stone, plastered over with white earth or
lime."<a id="FNanchor_X-58" href="#Footnote_X-58" class="fnanchor">[X-58]</a> Arlegui, in his <i>Chrónica</i>, speaks of them as
"grand edifices all of stone well-hewn and polished
from time immemorial." So nicely joined were the
blocks of stone that they seemed to have been 'born
so,' without the slightest trace of mortar; but the
author adds that they might have been joined with
the juice of some herbs or roots.<a id="FNanchor_X-59" href="#Footnote_X-59" class="fnanchor">[X-59]</a> Clavigero, who
claims to have derived his information from parties
who had visited the ruins,&mdash;since the hostile attitude
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605">605</a></span>
of the Apaches at the time of his own residence in
the country made a visit impracticable&mdash;was the first
to give any definite idea of these monuments, although
he also falls into several errors. He says:
"This place is known by the name of Casas Grandes
on account of a vast edifice still standing, which according
to the universal tradition of the people was
built by the Mexicans in their pilgrimage. This edifice
is constructed according to the plan of those in
New Mexico, that is composed of three stories and a
terrace above them, without doors in the lower story.
The entrance to the edifice is in the second story;
so that a ladder is required."<a id="FNanchor_X-60" href="#Footnote_X-60" class="fnanchor">[X-60]</a></p>

<p>Sr Escudero examined the ruins in 1819, and describes
them as "a group of rooms built with mud
walls, exactly oriented according to the four cardinal
points. The blocks of earth are of unequal size, but
placed with symmetry, and the perfection with which
they have lasted during a period which cannot be less
than three hundred years shows great skill in the art
of building. It is seen that the edifice had three
stories and a roof, with exterior stairways probably of
wood. The same class of construction is found still
in all the independent Indian towns of Moqui, north-east
from the state of Chihuahua. Most of the rooms
are very small with doors so small and narrow that
they seem like the cells of a prison."<a id="FNanchor_X-61" href="#Footnote_X-61" class="fnanchor">[X-61]</a> A writer in
the <i>Album Mexicano</i>, who visited the Casas Grandes
in 1842, wrote a description which is far superior to
anything that preceded it.<a id="FNanchor_X-62" href="#Footnote_X-62" class="fnanchor">[X-62]</a> Mr Hardy visited the
place, but his account affords very little information;<a id="FNanchor_X-63" href="#Footnote_X-63" class="fnanchor">[X-63]</a>
and Mr Wizlizenus gives a brief description evidently
drawn from some of the earlier authorities and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606">606</a></span>
faulty.<a id="FNanchor_X-64" href="#Footnote_X-64" class="fnanchor">[X-64]</a> Finally Mr Bartlett explored the
locality in 1851, and his description illustrated with
cuts is by far the most satisfactory extant. From his
account and that in the <i>Album</i> most of the following
information is derived.<a id="FNanchor_X-65" href="#Footnote_X-65" class="fnanchor">[X-65]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Casas Grandes&mdash;Chihuahua.</p>
</div>

<p>The ruined casas are about half a mile from the
modern Mexican town of the same name, located in a
finely chosen site, commanding a broad view over the
fertile valley of the Casas Grandes or San Miguel
river, which valley&mdash;or at least the river bottom&mdash;is
here two miles wide. This bottom is bounded by a
plateau about twenty-five feet higher, and the ruins
are found partly on the bottom and partly on the
more sterile plateau above. They consist of walls,
generally fallen and crumbled into heaps of rubbish,
but at some points, as at the corners and where supported
by partition walls, still standing to a height of
from five to thirty feet above the heaps of débris, and
some of them as high as fifty feet, if reckoned from
the level of the ground. The cuts on this and the
opposite pages represent views of the ruins from three
different standpoints, as sketched by Mr Bartlett.</p>

<img src="images/i607.jpg" width="550" height="496" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Casas Grandes&mdash;Chihuahua.</p>
</div>

<p>The material of the walls is sun-dried blocks of
mud and gravel, about twenty-two inches thick, and
of irregular length, generally about three feet, probably
formed and dried in situ. Of this material and
method of construction more details will be given in
the following chapter on the New Mexican region,
where the buildings are of a similar nature. The
walls are in some parts five feet thick, but were so
much damaged at the time of Mr Bartlett's visit
that nothing could be ascertained, at least without
excavation, respecting their finish on either surface.
The author of the account in the <i>Album</i> states that
the plaster which covers the blocks is of powdered
stone, but this may be doubted. There is no doubt,
however, that they were plastered on both interior
and exterior, with a composition much like that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608">608</a></span>
of which the blocks were made; Escudero found
some portions of the plaster still in place, but does
not state what was its composition. The remains of
the main structure, which was rectangular in its plan,
extend over an area measuring about eight hundred
feet from north to south, and two hundred and fifty
from east to west.<a id="FNanchor_X-66" href="#Footnote_X-66" class="fnanchor">[X-66]</a> Within this area are three great
heaps of ruined walls, but low connecting lines of
débris indicate that all formed one edifice, or were at
least connected by corridors. On the south the wall,
or the heaps indicating its existence, is continuous
and regular; of the northern side nothing is said;
but on the east and west the walls are very irregular,
with many angles and projections.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i608"></a>
<img src="images/i608.jpg" width="155" height="53" alt="" />
<p class="caption p2">Ground Plan&mdash;Casas Grandes.</p>
</div>

<p>The ground plan of the whole structure could not
be made out, at least in the limited time at Mr Bartlett's
disposal. He found, however, one row of apartments
whose plan is shown in the cut. Each of the
six shown is ten by twenty feet, and the small structure
in the corner of each is a pen rather than a room,
being only three or four feet high. In the <i>Album</i>,
the usual dimensions of the rooms are given as about
twelve and a half by sixteen and a half feet; one
very perfect room, however, being a little over four
feet square. Bartlett found many rooms altogether
too small for sleeping apartments, some of great size,
whose dimensions are not given, and several enclosures
too large to have been covered by a roof,
doubtless enclosed courtyards. One portion of standing
wall in the interior had a doorway narrower at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609">609</a></span>
the top than at the bottom, and two circular openings
or windows above it. The explorer of 1842 speaks
of doorways long, square, and round, some of them
being walled up at the bottom so as to form windows.</p>

<p class="p2">Not a fragment of wood or stone remained in 1851;
nor could any holes in the walls be found which
seemed to have held the original floor-timbers; and
consequently there was no way of determining the
number of stories. In 1842, however, a piece of rotten
wood was found, over a window as it seems; and
the people in the vicinity said they had found many
beams. No traces of any stairway was, however,
visible. No doubt the earlier accounts spoke of
wooden stairways, or ladders, because such means of
entrance were commonly used in similar and more
modern buildings in New Mexico; later writers converted
the conjectures of the first visitors into actual
fact; hence the galleries of wood and exterior stairways
spoken of by Wizlizenus and others.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine where the idea originated
that the structure had three stories; for the
walls still standing in places to a height of fifty feet,
notwithstanding the wear of three centuries at least,
would certainly indicate six or seven stories rather
than three. These high walls are always in the interior,
and the outer walls are in no part of a sufficient
height to indicate more than one story. The
general idea of the structure in its original condition,
formed from the descriptions and views, is that of an
immense central pile&mdash;similar to some of the Pueblo
towns of New Mexico, and particularly that of Taos,
of which a cut will be given in the following chapter&mdash;rising
to a height of six or seven stories, and surrounded
by lower houses built about several courtyards,
and presenting on the exterior a rectangular
form. Notwithstanding the imperfect exploration of
this ruin and its advanced state of dilapidation, the
reader of the following chapter will not fail to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610">610</a></span>
clearly what this Casa Grande was like
when still inhabited; for there is no doubt that this
building was used for a dwelling as well as for
other purposes, and this may be regarded as the
first instance in the northward progress of our investigation
where any remains of authentic aboriginal
dwellings have been met.</p>

<img src="images/i610.jpg" width="181" height="186" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Ground Plan&mdash;Casas Grandes.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote">BROKEN POTTERY.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty yards west of the
main building and somewhat higher on the plateau,
are seen the foundations of another structure of similar
nature and material, indicating a line of small
apartments built round an interior court, according
to the ground plan shown in the cut, the whole forming
a square with sides of about one hundred and
fifty feet. There are some other heaps in the vicinity
which may very likely represent buildings, of
whose original forms, however, they convey no idea,
besides some remains of what seemed to Mr Bartlett
to be very evidently those of modern Spanish buildings.
Between the two buildings described there are
three mounds or heaps of loose stones each about fifteen
feet high, which have not been opened. Escudero,
followed by García Conde, states that throughout
an extent of twenty leagues in length and ten
leagues in width in the valleys of the Casas Grandes
and Janos, mounds are found in great numbers&mdash;over
two thousand, as estimated in the <i>Album</i>&mdash;and that
such as have been opened have furnished painted pottery,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611">611</a></span>
metates, stone axes, and other utensils. One
visitor thought that one of the mounds presented
great regularity in its form and had a summit platform.</p>

<p>Escudero and Hardy report the existence of an
aqueduct or canal which formerly brought water from
a spring to the town. The following cut shows
specimens of broken pottery found in connection
with the ruins. The ornamentation is in black,
red, or brown, on a white or reddish ground. The
material is said to be superior in texture to any
manufactured in later times by the natives of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612">612</a></span>
region. The whole valley for miles around is strewn
with such fragments. Unbroken specimens of pottery
are not abundant, as is naturally the case in a
country traversed continually by roving bands of natives
to whom it is easier to pick up or dig out
earthen utensils than to manufacture or buy them.
Three specimens were however found by Mr Bartlett,
and are shown in the cut. Mr Hardy also sketched
a vase very similar to the first figure of the cut, and
he speaks of "good specimens of earthen images in
the Egyptian style, which are, to me at least, so perfectly
uninteresting, that I was at no pains to procure
any of them." According to the <i>Album</i>, some idols
had been found by the inhabitants among other relics,
and the women claimed to have discovered a monument
of antiquity which was of practical utility to
themselves, as well as of interest to archæologists&mdash;namely,
a jar filled with bear's grease! The pipe
shown in the cut, has a suspiciously modern look,
although included in Bartlett's plate of Chihuahuan
antiquities.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613">613</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FORTRESS AT CASAS GRANDES.</p>

<p>The inhabitants pointed out to Bartlett, on the top
of a high mountain, some ten miles south-west of
the ruins described, what they said was a stone fortress
of two or three stories. Escudero describes this
monument, which he locates at a distance of only
two leagues, as a watch-tower or sentry-station on
the top of a high cliff; and says that the southern
slope of the hill has many lines of stones at irregular
intervals, with heaps of loose stones at their extremities.
This is probably, in the absence of more
definite information the more credible account. The
<i>Album</i> represents this monument as a fortress built
of great stones very perfectly joined, though without
the aid of mortar. The wall is said to be eighteen
or twenty feet thick, and a road cut in the rock leads
to the summit. At this time, 1842, the works were
being destroyed for the stone they contained. Clavigero
speaks of the hill works as "a fortress defended
on one side by a high mountain, and on other sides
by a wall about seven feet thick, the foundations of
which yet remain. There are seen in this fortress
stones as large as millstones; the beams of the roofs
are of pine, and well worked. In the centre of the
vast edifice is a mound, built as it seems, for the
purpose of keeping guard and watching the enemy."
Clavigero evidently confounds the two groups of
ruins, and from his error, and a similar one by others,
come the accounts which represent the Casas Grandes
as built of stone. He mentions obsidian mirrors
among the relics dug up here, probably without any
authority. The cut from Bartlett shows a stone
metate found among the ruins.</p>

<p>So far as any conclusions or comparisons suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614">614</a></span>
by this Chihuahuan ruin are concerned, they may
best be deferred to the end of the following chapter.
The Casas Grandes, and the ruins of the northern or
New Mexican group, should be classed together.
They were the work of the same people, at about the
same epoch.

</p>

<p>Crossing the boundary line between the northern
and southern republics, and entering the territory of
the Pacific United States, I shall present in the
present chapter all that is known of antiquities in
Arizona and New Mexico. An area approximating
somewhat the form of a right-angle triangle, with a
base of four hundred miles and a perpendicular of
three hundred, includes all the remains in this region.
The valley of the Rio Gila, with those of its tributary
streams, is the southern boundary, or base,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616">616</a></span>
stretching along the thirty-third parallel of latitude;
the Rio Grande del Norte, flowing southward between
the one hundred and sixth and one hundred
and seventh meridians, forms with its valley the eastern
limit or perpendicular; while on the north and
west the region is bounded by the Rio Colorado as a
hypothenuse, albeit a very winding one. The latter
river might, however, be straightened, thus improving
materially the geometrical symmetry of my triangle,
without interfering much with ancient remains,
as will be seen when the relics of the Colorado section
are described.</p>

<p class="p2">The face of the country is made up of fertile valleys,
precipitous cañons, rugged mountains, and desert
table-lands, the latter predominating and constituting
a very large portion of the area. Arizona and New
Mexico since first they became known to the outside
world, have always had, as they still have, more or
less of the mysterious connected with them. Here
have been located for over three hundred years the
wonderful peoples, marvelous cities, extensive ruins,
mines of untold wealth, unparalleled natural phenomena,
savages of the most bloodthirsty and merciless
character, and other marvels, that from the narratives
of adventurers and missionaries have found their way
into romance and history. This was in a certain
sense the last American stronghold of the mysterious
as connected with the aborigines, where the native
races yet dispute the progress of a foreign civilization.</p>

<p>And the wondrous tales of this border land between
civilization and savagism, always exaggerated, had
nevertheless much foundation in fact. The Pueblo
tribes of New Mexico and the Moquis of Arizona are
a wonderful people when we consider the wall of savagism
which envelopes them; their towns of many-storied
structures are better foundations than usually
exist for travelers' tales of magnificent cities; ruins
are abundant, showing that the pueblo nations were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617">617</a></span>
in the past more numerous, powerful, and cultured,
than Europeans have found them; rich mines are now
worked, and yet richer ones are awaiting development;
few greater natural curiosities have been seen
in America than the cañon of the Colorado, with perpendicular
sides in some places a mile in height; and
the Apaches are yet on the war-path, making a trip
through the country much more dangerous now than
at the time when the Spaniards first visited it.</p>

<p>Although a large part of these states is still in the
possession of the natives, and no official or scientific
commission has made explorations which were especially
directed to its antiquarian treasures, yet the
labors of the priest, hunter, immigrant, Indian fighter,
railroad surveyor, and prospector, have left few valleys,
hills, or cañons, mountain passes or desert plains
unvisited. While it is not probable that all even of
the more important ruins have been seen, or described,
we may feel very sure, here as in Yucatan, from the
uniformity of such monuments as have been brought
to light, that no very important developments remain
to be made respecting the character, or type, of the
New Mexican remains.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">EXPLORATION OF NEW MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2">This country was first visited by the Spaniards in
the middle of the sixteenth century. The part
known to them as New Mexico, and to which their
efforts as conquistadores and missionaries were particularly
directed, was the valley of the Rio Grande
and its tributary streams, but the whole district was
frequently crossed and recrossed by the padres down
to the latter part of the seventeenth century. Reports
of large cities and powerful nations far in the
north reached Mexico through the natives as early as
1530; Cabeza de Vaca, ship-wrecked on the coast of
the Mexican gulf, wandered through the regions south
of and near New Mexico, in 1535-6; roused by the
shipwrecked soldier's tale, Fr Marco de Niza penetrated
at least into Arizona from Sinaloa in 1539,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618">618</a></span>
and was followed by Vasquez de Coronado, who
reached the Pueblo towns on the Rio Grande in 1540;
Antonio de Espejo followed the course of the great
river northward to the Pueblos in 1583, and in 1598
New Mexico was brought altogether under Spanish
rule by Juan de Oñate. In 1680 the natives threw
off the yoke by revolt, but were again subdued fifteen
years later, and the Spaniards retained the power,
though not always without difficulty until 1848, when
the territory came into the possession of the United
States. The archives of the missions are said to have
been for the most part destroyed in the revolt of
1680, and consequently their history previous to that
date is only known in outline; since 1680 the annals
are tolerably clear and complete. The diaries of the
Spanish pioneers have been, most of them, preserved
in one form or another, and show that the authors
visited many of the ruins that have attracted the
attention of later explorers, and also that they found
many of the towns inhabited that now exist only as
ruins. Their accurate accounts of towns still standing
and inhabited attest, moreover, their general
veracity as explorers.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the explorations undertaken
under the authority of the United States government,
for the purpose of surveying a practicable
route for an interoceanic railroad, and also to establish
a boundary line between American and Mexican
territory, that we owe nearly all our accurate descriptions
of the ancient monuments of this group.
These exploring parties, as well as the military expeditions
during the war with Mexico, were accompanied
by scientific men and artists, whose observations
were made public in their official reports, together
with illustrative plates. They generally followed the
course of the larger rivers, but the ruins discovered
by them show a remarkable similarity one to another,
and consequently the reports of trappers and guides
respecting remains of similar type on the smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619">619</a></span>
streams, may be generally accepted as worthy of
more implicit confidence than can generally be accorded
to such reports.</p>

<p>In this division of Pacific States antiquities, which
may be spoken of as the New Mexican group, we
shall find, 1st, the remains of ancient stone and adobe
buildings in all stages of disintegration, from standing
walls with roofs and floors to shapeless heaps of
débris or simple lines of foundation-stones; 2d, anomalous
structures of stone or earth, the purpose of
which, either by reason of their advanced state of
ruin or of the slight attention given them by travelers,
is not apparent; 3d, traces of aboriginal agriculture
in the shape of <i>acequias</i> and <i>zanjas</i>, or irrigating
canals and ditches; 4th, pottery, always in fragments;
5th, implements and ornaments of stone and shell, not
numerous; and 6th, painted or engraved figures on
cliffs, boulders, and the sides of natural caverns.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MOUTH OF THE COLORADO.</p>

<p>About the mouth of the Colorado there are no
authentic remains of aboriginal work dating back beyond
the coming of the Spaniards, although Mr
Bartlett found just below the mouth of the Gila
traces of cultivation, which seemed to him, judging
from the growth of trees that covered them, not to
be the work of the present tribes in the vicinity. I
find also an absurd newspaper report&mdash;and no part of
the Pacific States has been more prolific of such reports
than that now under consideration&mdash;of a wonderful
ruined city of hewn stone somewhere about the
head of the Gulf of California. This city included
numerous dwellings, circular walls of granite, sculptured
hieroglyphics, and seven great pyramids, not
unlike the famous Central American cities of Palenque
and Copan. Some rude figures scratched or
painted on the surface of a boulder, seen by a traveler,
have been proved by experience to be ample foundation
for such a rumor.<a id="FNanchor_XI-1" href="#Footnote_XI-1" class="fnanchor">[XI-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ROCK-INSCRIPTIONS OF THE GILA.</p>

<p>Ascending the Rio Gila eastward from its junction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_620">620</a></span>
with the Colorado, for some two hundred miles we
find nothing that can be classed with ancient monuments
except natural heaps of large boulders at two
points, the flat sides of which are "covered with rude
figures of men, animals, and other objects of grotesque
forms, all pecked in with a sharp instrument." The
accompanying cut shows some of these boulder-sculptures
as they were sketched by Bartlett in 1852.
Some of them seemed of recent origin, while many
were much defaced by exposure, and apparently of
great age. The newer carvings in some cases extend
over the older ones, and many are found on the under
side of the rocks, where they must have been executed
before they fell to their present position. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621">621</a></span>
locality of the sculptured rocks is shown on the map;
the first is about fifty miles east of Fort Yuma,
and the second twenty miles west of the big bend of
the Gila, both on the south bank. Two additional
incised figures are given in the following cut from
Froebel's sketches, since the author thinks that Bartlett
may have selected his specimens with a view to
strengthen his theory that the figures are not hieroglyphics
with a definite meaning.<a id="FNanchor_XI-2" href="#Footnote_XI-2" class="fnanchor">[XI-2]</a></p>

<p>Between the Pima villages and the junction of
the San Pedro with the Gila, stands the most famous
ruin of the whole region&mdash;the Casa Grande,
or Casa de Montezuma, which it is safe to say has
been mentioned by every writer on American antiquity.
Coronado during his trip from Culiacan to
the 'seven cities' in 1540, visited a building called
Chichilticale, or 'red house,' which is supposed with
much reason to have been the Casa Grande. The
only account of Coronado's trip which gives any description
of the building is that of Castañeda, who
says, "Chichilticale of which so much had been said
[probably by the guides or natives] proved to be a
house in ruins and without a roof; which seemed,
however, to have been fortified. It was clear that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622">622</a></span>
this house, built of red earth, was the work of civilized
people who had come from far away." "A
house which had long been inhabited by a people who
came from Cíbola. The earth in this country is red.
The house was large; it seemed to have served as a
fortress."<a id="FNanchor_XI-3" href="#Footnote_XI-3" class="fnanchor">[XI-3]</a></p>

<p>Father Kino heard of the ruin while visiting the
northern missions of Sonora in the early part of 1694.
He was at first incredulous, but the information having
been confirmed by other reports of the natives,
he visited the Casa Grande later in the same year,
and said mass within its walls. Since Kino was not
accompanied at the time by Padre Mange, his secretary,
who usually kept the diary of his expeditions,
no definite account resulted from this first visit.<a id="FNanchor_XI-4" href="#Footnote_XI-4" class="fnanchor">[XI-4]</a></p>

<p>In 1697, however, Padre Kino revisited the place,
in company this time with Mange, who in his diary
of the trip wrote what may be regarded as the first
definite description.<a id="FNanchor_XI-5" href="#Footnote_XI-5" class="fnanchor">[XI-5]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_623">623</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CASA GRANDE OF THE GILA.</p>

<p>Padre Jacobo Sedelmair visited the Casa Grande
in 1744, but in his narrative he copies Mange's account.
He went further, however, and discovered
other ruins.<a id="FNanchor_XI-6" href="#Footnote_XI-6" class="fnanchor">[XI-6]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">AUTHORITIES ON THE CASA GRANDE.</p>

<p>Lieut C. M. Bernal seems to have been military
commandant in Kino's expedition, and he also describes
the ruin in his report.<a id="FNanchor_XI-7" href="#Footnote_XI-7" class="fnanchor">[XI-7]</a> Padres Garcés and
Font made a journey in 1775-6, under Capt. Anza,
to the Gila and Colorado valleys, and thence to the
missions of Alta California and the Moqui towns.
Both mention the ruin in their diaries, the latter
giving quite a full account. I know not if Padre
Font's diary has ever been printed, but I have in my
collection an English manuscript translation from the
original in the archives at Guadalajara,&mdash;perhaps the
same copy from which Mr Bartlett made the extracts
which he printed in his work.<a id="FNanchor_XI-8" href="#Footnote_XI-8" class="fnanchor">[XI-8]</a> Font's plan is not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624">624</a></span>
given with the translation, but in Beaumont's <i>Crónica
de Mechoacan</i>, a very important work never published,
of which I have a copy made from the original
for the Mexican Imperial Library of Maximilian, I
find a description of the Casa Grande, which appears
to have been quoted literally from Font's diary, and
which also contains the ground plan of the ruined
edifice. I shall notice hereafter its variations from
the plan which I shall copy.<a id="FNanchor_XI-9" href="#Footnote_XI-9" class="fnanchor">[XI-9]</a> A brief account was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625">625</a></span>
given in the <i>Rudo Ensayo</i>, written about 1761, and
by Velarde in his notice of the Pimería, written
probably toward the close of the eighteenth century;
but neither of these descriptions contained any additional
information, having been made up probably
from the preceding.<a id="FNanchor_XI-10" href="#Footnote_XI-10" class="fnanchor">[XI-10]</a></p>

<p>Finally the Casa Grande has been visited, sketched,
and described by Emory and Johnston, connected
with Gen. Kearny's military expedition to California
in 1846; by Bartlett with the Mexican Boundary
Commission in 1852; and by Ross Browne in 1863.<a id="FNanchor_XI-11" href="#Footnote_XI-11" class="fnanchor">[XI-11]</a></p>

<p>The descriptions of different writers do not differ
very materially one from another, Bartlett's among
the later, and Font's of the earlier accounts being the
most complete. From all the authorities I make up
the following description, although the extracts which
I have already given include nearly all that can be
said on the subject. The Casa Grande stands about
two miles and a half south of the bank of the Gila;&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626">626</a></span>
is all the early writers call the distance about
a league; Bartlett and Emory say nothing of the distance,
and Ross Browne says it is half an hour's ride.
The Gila valley in this region is a level bottom of
varying width, with nearly perpendicular banks of
earth. Opposite the ruin the bottom is about a mile
wide on the southern bank of the river, and the ruin
itself stands on the raised plateau beyond, surrounded
by a thick growth of mesquite with an occasional
pitahaya. The height and nature of the ascent from
the bottom to the plateau at this particular point are
not stated; but from the fact that acequias are reported
leading from the river to the buildings, it would
seem that the ascent must be very slight and gradual.</p>

<p>The appearance of the ruins in 1863 is shown in
the cut as sketched by Ross Browne. Other sketches
by Bartlett, Emory, and Johnston, agree very well
with the one given, but none of them indicate the
presence of the mesquite forest mentioned in Mr
Bartlett's text. The material of the buildings is
adobe,<a id="FNanchor_XI-12" href="#Footnote_XI-12" class="fnanchor">[XI-12]</a> that is, the ordinary mud of the locality mixed
with gravel. Most writers say nothing of its color,
although Bernal in 1697 pronounced it 'white clay,'
and Johnston also says it is white, probably with an
admixture of lime, which, as he states, is abundant in
the vicinity. Mr Hutton, a civil engineer well acquainted
with the ruins, assured Mr Simpson that the
surrounding earth is of a reddish color, although by
reason of the pebbles the Casa has a whitish appearance
in certain reflections. This matter of color
is of no great importance except to prove the identity
of the building with Castañeda's Chichilticale,
which he expressly states to have been built of red
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628">628</a></span>
earth.<a id="FNanchor_XI-13" href="#Footnote_XI-13" class="fnanchor">[XI-13]</a> The material instead of being formed into
small rectangular or brick-shaped blocks, as is customary
in all Spanish American countries to this day,
seems in this aboriginal structure to have been molded&mdash;perhaps
by means of wooden boxes&mdash;and dried
where it was to remain in the walls, in blocks of
varying size, but generally four feet long by two feet
in width and thickness. The outer surface of the
walls was plastered with the same material which
constituted the blocks, and the inner walls were hard-finished
with a finer composition of the same nature,
which in many parts has retained its smooth and
even polished surface. Adobe is a very durable building-material,
so long as a little attention is given to
repairs, but it is really wonderful that the walls of
the Casa Grande have resisted, uncared for, the ravages
of time and the elements for over three hundred
years of known age, and of certainly a century&mdash;perhaps
much more&mdash;of pre-Spanish existence.</p>

<p class="caption">Casa Grande of the Gila.</p>
</div>

<p>The buildings that still have upright walls are
three in number, and in the largest of these both the
exterior and interior walls are so nearly perfect as to
show accurately not only the original form and size,
but the division of the interior into apartments. Its
dimensions on the ground are fifty feet from north to
south, by forty feet from east to west. The outer
wall is about five feet thick at the base, diminishing
slightly towards the top, in a curved line on the exterior,
but perpendicular on the inside.<a id="FNanchor_XI-14" href="#Footnote_XI-14" class="fnanchor">[XI-14]</a> The interior
is divided by partition walls, slightly thinner than
the others, into five apartments, as shown in the accompanying
ground plan taken from Bartlett. Font's
plan given by Beaumont agrees with this, except that
additional doors are represented at the points marked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629">629</a></span>
with a dot, and no doorway is indicated at <i>a</i>. The
three central rooms are each about eight by fourteen
feet, and the others ten by thirty-two feet, as nearly
as may be estimated from Bartlett's plan and the
statements of other writers.<a id="FNanchor_XI-15" href="#Footnote_XI-15" class="fnanchor">[XI-15]</a> The doors in the
centre of each façade are three feet wide and five feet
high, and somewhat narrower at the top than at the
bottom, except that on the western front, which is
two by seven or eight feet. There are some small
windows, both square and circular in the outer and
inner walls. The following cut shows an elevation of
the side and end, also from Bartlett.<a id="FNanchor_XI-16" href="#Footnote_XI-16" class="fnanchor">[XI-16]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Elevations of the Casa Grande.</p>
</div>

<p>Remains of floor timbers show that the main walls
were three stories high, or, as the lower rooms are
represented by Font as about ten English feet high,
about thirty feet in height; while the central portion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630">630</a></span>
is eight or ten feet&mdash;probably one story&mdash;higher.
Mr Bartlett judged from the mass of débris within
that the main building had originally four stories;
but as the earliest visitors speak of three and four
stories&mdash;some referring to the central, others apparently
to the outer portions&mdash;there would seem to be
no satisfactory evidence that the building was over
forty feet high, although it is possible that the outer
and inner walls were originally of the same height.
Respecting the arrangement of apartments in the
upper stories, there is of course no means of judging,
all the floors having fallen. There may, however,
have been additional partition walls resting on the
floors, and these may have helped to make up the
débris noticed by Mr Bartlett. The floors were evidently
supported by round timbers four or five inches
in diameter, inserted in the walls and stretching
across the rooms at regular intervals. The holes
where the beams were placed, and in many cases the
ends of the beams themselves are still visible. At
the time of Padre Kino's visit one floor in an adjoining
ruin was still perfect, and was formed by cross-sticks
placed upon the round floor-timbers and covered
with a thick cake of mud, or adobe.<a id="FNanchor_XI-17" href="#Footnote_XI-17" class="fnanchor">[XI-17]</a> No marks
of any cutting instrument were noticed by any visitor
except Mr Browne, who says "the ends show very
plainly marks of the blunt instrument with which
they were cut&mdash;probably a stone hatchet."<a id="FNanchor_XI-18" href="#Footnote_XI-18" class="fnanchor">[XI-18]</a> The
timbers, of cedar, or <i>sabino</i>, show by their charred
ends that the interior was ruined by fire; and Johnston
found other evidences that the walls had been
exposed to great heat.<a id="FNanchor_XI-19" href="#Footnote_XI-19" class="fnanchor">[XI-19]</a> Nothing seems more natural
than that the building should have been burned by
some band of Apaches. No traces of stairways have
been found even by the earliest visitors; so that the
original means of communication with the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631">631</a></span>
stories may be reasonably supposed to have been
wooden ladders, still used by the Pueblo natives in
buildings not very unlike what this must originally
have been. Mr Bartlett and also Johnston found and
sketched some rude figures painted in red lines on
the smooth wall of one apartment, but which had
disappeared at the time of Mr Browne's visit.</p>

<p>The descriptions of successive explorers show clearly
the gradually increasing effects of time and the elements
on this ruin; from Browne's sketch it would
seem that the walls, undermined at the base by the
yearly rains, as is always the case with neglected
adobe structures, must soon fall; although I learned
from a band of Arizona natives who visited San
Francisco in 1873 that the Casa was still standing.
When the adobe walls have once fallen, they will
require but one or two seasons to crumble and become
reduced to a shapeless mound of mud and
gravel; as has been the case with most of the eleven
other buildings reported here by the first comers, and
the existence of which there is no reason to doubt.</p>

<p>Of the additional casas seen by Kino and others no
particular description was given, save that Font describes
one of them as measuring twenty-six by
eighteen feet on the ground. Only two of them show
any remains of standing walls, one on the south-west
and the other on the north-east of the Casa Grande.
The standing portions of the former seemed to indicate
a structure similar in plan to the chief edifice,
although much smaller; the latter is of still smaller
dimensions and its remains convey no idea of its original
form. "In every direction," says Mr Bartlett,
"as far as the eye can reach, are seen heaps of ruined
edifices, with no portions of their walls standing," and
Mange, Kino, and Font observed also shapeless heaps
covering the plain for a distance of two leagues.</p>

<p>Father Font found "ruins indicating a fence or
wall which surrounded the house and other buildings,"
mentioning a ruin in the south-west angle which had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632">632</a></span>
divisions and an upper story. This corner structure
may be the same that has been mentioned as standing
south-west of the Casa Grande, and Font very likely
mistook the heaps of fallen houses for the remains of
a wall, since no such wall was seen by Kino and
Mange. The dimensions of this supposed wall, four
hundred and twenty feet from north to south, and
two hundred and sixty feet from east to west, were
erroneously applied by Arricivita and Humboldt, followed
by others, to the Casa Grande itself, an error
which has given a very exaggerated idea of the size
of that edifice.<a id="FNanchor_XI-20" href="#Footnote_XI-20" class="fnanchor">[XI-20]</a></p>

<p>Traces of acequias are mentioned by all as occurring
frequently in the vicinity, especially in the Gila bottom
between the ruins and the Pima villages. No
plan or accurate description of these irrigating works
has been given. Probably they were simple shallow
ditches in the ground, still traceable at some points.
Mange describes the main canal as twenty-seven feet
wide, ten feet deep, capable of carrying half the
water of the Gila, and extending from the river for a
circuit of three leagues round the ruins. Considering
the general conformation of the bottom and plateau
in this part of the Gila valley, it seems impossible
that a canal ten, or even twenty, feet deep could have
reached the level of the river, or that so grand an
acequia should have escaped the notice of later explorers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS REMAINS.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous remains near the Casa Grande,
besides the mounds formed by fallen houses, the irrigating
ditches, and the fragments of pottery strewn
over the adjacent country in the greatest profusion,
are two in number. The first is a circular embankment,
three hundred feet in circumference, situated
about six hundred feet north-west from the chief ruin.
Its height and material are not stated, but it is undoubtedly
of the surrounding earth. Johnston considers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633">633</a></span>
it a filled-up well; while Bartlett pronounces
the circle a simple corral, or enclosure for stock, although
of course it could not have been built in
aboriginal times for such a purpose. The second
monument is only a few yards north of the circle, and
is described by Johnston, the only one who mentions
its existence, as a terrace measuring about three
hundred by two hundred feet and five feet high.
Resting on the terrace is a pyramid only eight feet
high, but having a summit platform seventy-five feet
square, affording from the top a broad view up and
down the valley. A more complete survey of this
pyramid would be very desirable, not that there is
any reason to question Mr Johnston's reliability as
an explorer, but because, as will be seen, this mound,
if it be not like the rest, formed by fallen adobe walls,
together with the circular embankment, present a
marked contrast to all other monuments of the New
Mexican group.<a id="FNanchor_XI-21" href="#Footnote_XI-21" class="fnanchor">[XI-21]</a></p>

<p>Sedelmair and Velarde speak rather vaguely of a
reservoir, or tank, six leagues southward of the Gila,
which was one hundred and ten by one hundred and
sixty-five feet, with walls of adobe 'or of masonry.'<a id="FNanchor_XI-22" href="#Footnote_XI-22" class="fnanchor">[XI-22]</a></p>

<p>A few miles further up the river, westward from
the Casa Grande, and on the opposite or northern
side Padre Kino's party saw a ruined edifice, and
three men were sent across to examine it. They
found some walls over three feet thick still standing,
and other heaps of ruins in the vicinity showing that
a large town had once stood on the site. Emory
found there only a "pile of broken pottery and foundation
stones of the black basalt, making a mound about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634">634</a></span>
ten feet" high.<a id="FNanchor_XI-23" href="#Footnote_XI-23" class="fnanchor">[XI-23]</a> Still farther west, near the Pima
villages, Johnston found another circular enclosure,
and also what he calls a mound, ninety by a hundred
and fifty feet, and six feet high, having a low terrace
of sixty by three hundred feet on the eastern side, all
covered with loose basaltic rocks, dirt, and pottery.
I consider it not impossible that this mound was
formed by the walls of a building which assumed a
symmetrical shape in falling.<a id="FNanchor_XI-24" href="#Footnote_XI-24" class="fnanchor">[XI-24]</a> Sedelmair speaks of
a group of ruins on the southern bank of the river,
twelve leagues below the Casa Grande; but no later
writer mentions such remains.<a id="FNanchor_XI-25" href="#Footnote_XI-25" class="fnanchor">[XI-25]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS IN THE SALADO VALLEY.</p>

<p class="p2">The principal tributary of the Gila from the north
is the Rio Salado, or Salinas, the mouth of which is
below the Casa Grande, and into which, near its
mouth, flows the Rio Verde, or San Francisco. The
Spaniards seem not to have ascended these streams;
or at least not to have discovered any ruins in their
valleys. The guides, however, reported to the missionaries
the existence of ruins on the Rio Verde, in
the north, similar to those on the Gila.<a id="FNanchor_XI-26" href="#Footnote_XI-26" class="fnanchor">[XI-26]</a> Sedelmair
also discovered in 1744, the ruins of a large edifice
and several smaller ones in the space between the
Gila and Salado.<a id="FNanchor_XI-27" href="#Footnote_XI-27" class="fnanchor">[XI-27]</a> Velarde speaks of ruined buildings
of three stories at the junction of the rivers
Salado and Gila, and other remains at the junction

<p>A guide reported to Emory a casa in the Salado
valley, complete except the floors and roof, of large
dimensions, with glazed walls, and the imprint of a
naked foot in the adobe.<a id="FNanchor_XI-29" href="#Footnote_XI-29" class="fnanchor">[XI-29]</a> One of four stone axes
shown in a cut to be given later, was found in this
valley and sketched by Whipple.<a id="FNanchor_XI-30" href="#Footnote_XI-30" class="fnanchor">[XI-30]</a> The Salado ruins
between the Gila and Verde, on the south bank,
about thirty-five miles from the mouth, were examined
by Mr Bartlett. They are built on the plateau
beyond the river bottom, and are exclusively of adobe.
They are very numerous, but consist for the most
part of shapeless heaps indicating the location of
buildings and long lines of walls. In only two instances
did portions of standing walls remain; being
in one case the ruins of an adobe building over two
hundred feet long and from sixty to eighty feet wide,
facing the cardinal points, and, so far as could be
judged by the débris, three or four stories high; the
others were about two hundred yards distant, and represented
a smaller structure. There are traces of a
wall which appears to have surrounded the larger
building. From the top of the principal pile, similar
heaps of ruins may be seen in all directions, including
a range of them running north and south at a
distance of about a mile eastward. The latter were
not visited, but were said by the natives to be similar
in every respect to the others. A small circular enclosure,
whose dimensions are not given, was seen
among the ruins, and there were also excavations
along the sides of some of the heaps, as if they had
furnished the material for the original structures. In
the river bottom irrigating canals are of frequent occurrence,
one of them from twenty to twenty-five
feet wide and four to five feet deep, formed by cutting
down the bank of the plateau, along which it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636">636</a></span>
extends for many miles. The whole vicinity of the
ruins, as in the Gila Valley, is strewn with fragments
of earthen ware. These earthen ware fragments are
of a very uniform character throughout the New
Mexican region, and will be illustrated in another
part of this chapter.<a id="FNanchor_XI-31" href="#Footnote_XI-31" class="fnanchor">[XI-31]</a></p>

<p>Trappers and natives report that these remains continue
indefinitely up the valleys of both the Salado
and Verde. Mr Leroux, who served as guide to several
of the United States military expeditions, passed
up the Verde valley in 1854 on his way from the
Gila to the Colorado Chiquito, keeping a diary, a
part of which has been printed.<a id="FNanchor_XI-32" href="#Footnote_XI-32" class="fnanchor">[XI-32]</a> He claims to have
found the river banks covered in many places with
ruins of stone buildings and broken pottery. The
walls were of solid masonry still standing from ten
to twenty feet high in two stories, three feet thick
and from fifty to seventy-five feet long. Except in
material the structures were not unlike the Casa
Grande of the Gila, and were generally situated in
the most fertile parts of the valley, surrounded by
traces of acequias; although in one instance the ruins
of a town were ten miles from the nearest water. A
complete change of building material within so short
a distance is somewhat extraordinary, but there is no
other reason to doubt the accuracy of this report.
These ruins are not very far from Prescott in the
north, and Fort McDowell in the south, and I regret
not having been able to obtain from officers in the
Arizona service the information which they must have
acquired respecting those remains, if they actually
exist, during the past ten or fifteen years.<a id="FNanchor_XI-33" href="#Footnote_XI-33" class="fnanchor">[XI-33]</a>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO CREEK AND THE UPPER GILA.</p>

<p>Whipple describes some ruins discovered by him in
1854 on Pueblo Creek and other small streams which
form the head waters of the Verde. They consist of
what seem to have been two fortified settlements, and
a third separate fortification. The first was an irregular
stone enclosure on the top of a hill three or four
hundred feet high. The walls were from eight to ten
feet high, and the interior was divided by partition
walls five feet thick into different compartments. On
the slopes of the hill were traces of adobe walls with
the usual abundance of broken pottery. The second
was located in a fertile spot on a fork of the Pueblo
Creek, and consisted of a mass of stones, six feet
thick and several feet high, forming a square enclosure
"five paces in the clear." The third work is
situated about eight miles further west, and commands
what is known as Aztec Pass. It is an enclosure
one hundred feet long, twenty-five feet wide
at one end and twenty at the other, the walls being
four feet thick and five feet in height. In the absence
of any definite statement on the subject these
northern fortifications are presumed to be of rough,
or unhewn, stones without mortar.<a id="FNanchor_XI-34" href="#Footnote_XI-34" class="fnanchor">[XI-34]</a></p>

<p>From the mouth of the San Pedro, which joins the
Gila about forty miles eastward of the Casa Grande,
up the Gila valley eastward, ruins of ancient edifices
are frequently found on both banks of the river.
Emory says "wherever the mountains did not impinge
too close on the river and shut out the valley,
they were seen in great abundance, enough, I should
think, to indicate a former population of at least one
hundred thousand; and in one place there is a long
wide valley, twenty miles in length, much of which is
covered with the ruins of buildings and broken pottery."
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638">638</a></span>
The remains consist uniformly of lines of rough
amygdaloid stones rounded by attrition, no one of
which remains upon another, apparently the foundations
upon which were erected adobe walls that have
altogether disappeared. The plan of the buildings as
indicated by their foundations was generally rectangular;
many of them were very similar to the modern
Spanish dwellings, as shown in the accompanying cut;
but a few were circular or of irregular form. One of
them just below the junction of the Santo Domingo,
on an isolated knoll, was shaped as in the following cut,
with faces of from ten to thirty feet. Besides the traces
of what seem to be dwellings, there were also observed,
an enclosure or circular line of stones, four
hundred yards in circumference; a similar circle ninety
yards in circumference with a house in the centre; an
estufa with an entrance at the top; some well-preserved
cedar posts; and some inscribed figures on the
cliffs of an arroyo, similar to those lower down the
river, of which cuts have been given. The native
Pimas reported to the Spaniards in early times the
existence of a building far up the Gila, the labyrinthine
plan of which they traced on the sand, as shown
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639">639</a></span>
in the cut. Emory and Johnston found these traces
of aboriginal towns in at least twelve places on the
Gila above the San Pedro, the largest being at the
mouth of a stream flowing from the south-east, probably
the Santo Domingo. I find no mention of ruins
on any of the smaller tributaries of the Gila above
the Casa Grande, though it seems very probable that
such ruins may exist, similar to those on the main
stream. A painted stone, a beaver-tooth, and marine
shells were the miscellaneous relics found by Johnston
among the ruins, besides the usual large quantities
of broken pottery. Emory speaks of a few
ornaments, principally immense well-turned beads of
the size of hens' eggs, also fragments of agate and
obsidian. The latter explorer gives a plate of rock-hieroglyphics
of doubtful antiquity, and Froebel also
sketched certain inscriptions on an isolated rock.
Six or eight perfectly symmetrical and well-turned
holes about ten inches deep and six or eight inches
wide at the top were noticed, and supposed to have
served for grinding corn.<a id="FNanchor_XI-35" href="#Footnote_XI-35" class="fnanchor">[XI-35]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640">640</a></span></p>

<p>Having presented all that is known of antiquities
upon the Gila and its tributaries, I pass to the Colorado,
the western and northern boundary of the New
Mexican territory. The banks of the Colorado
Cañon, for the river forms no valley proper, are for
the most part unexplored, and no relics of antiquity
are reported by reliable authorities; indeed, from the
peculiar nature of this region, it is not likely that
any ruins ever, will be found in the immediate vicinity
of the river.<a id="FNanchor_XI-36" href="#Footnote_XI-36" class="fnanchor">[XI-36]</a></p>

<p>On Bill Williams' Fork there is a newspaper report,
resting on no known authority, of walls enclosing
an area some eight hundred feet in circumference,
still perfect to the height of six or eight feet.<a id="FNanchor_XI-37" href="#Footnote_XI-37" class="fnanchor">[XI-37]</a> The
only other traces of the former inhabitants found on
this stream are painted cave and cliff pictures or
hieroglyphics. Two caves have their walls and the
surrounding rocks thus decorated; they are about a
mile apart, near the junction of the Santa María,
and one of them is near a spring. Many of the inscriptions
appear very ancient, and some were painted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_641">641</a></span>
on cliffs very difficult of access. The cut shows a
specimen from the sketches made by Möllhausen.
The streak which crosses the cut in the centre, extends
to the left beyond the other figures, and only
half its length is shown. This streak is red with
white borders; the other figures are red, purple, and
white.<a id="FNanchor_XI-38" href="#Footnote_XI-38" class="fnanchor">[XI-38]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRIBUTARIES OF THE COLORADO.</p>

<p>Leaving Bill Williams' Fork, and passing the
Pueblo Creek ruins already described, which are not
far distant, I follow the routes of Sitgreaves, Ives,
and Whipple, north-westward to the Colorado Chiquito,
a distance of about one hundred miles, striking
the river at a point a hundred miles above its supposed
junction with the main Colorado. In this
region we again find numerous ruined buildings with
the usual scattered pottery, respecting which our
knowledge is derived from the explorers just named.
The ruins occur at all prominent points, both near
the river and away from it towards the west, at intervals
of eight or nine miles, the exact location not
being definitely fixed. The material employed here
is stone, and some of the houses were three stories
high. A view of one ruin as sketched by Sitgreaves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642">642</a></span>
is shown in the cut. On a rocky eminence were
found by Whipple stone enclosures, apparently for
defense. According to Mr Sitgreaves the houses
resembled in every particular, save that no adobe was
used, the inhabited Pueblo towns of New Mexico.
His description, like that of Möllhausen and Whipple,
would doubtless be much more complete and satisfactory,
had they not previously seen the Pueblo
towns and other ruins further east. Some of the
ruins are far from water, and Sitgreaves suggests
that the lava sand blown from the neighboring
mountains may have filled up the springs which
originally furnished a supply.</p>

<p class="caption">Vases from the Colorado Chiquito.</p>

<p>The cut from Whipple shows two vases found here,
restored from fragments. This is one of the rarest
kinds of pottery found in the region, and is said by
Whipple not to be manufactured by any North
American Indians of modern times. It is seldom
colored, the ornamentation being raised or indented,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643">643</a></span>
somewhat like that on molded glassware, and of excellent
workmanship. The material is light-colored
and porous, and the vases are not glazed. The ordinary
fragments of earthen ware found on this river
will be represented in another part of this chapter.
Some very rude and simple rock-inscriptions were noticed,
and a newspaper writer states that the names
of Jesuit priests who visited the place in the sixteenth
century are inscribed on the rocks. Some additional
and not very well-founded reports of antiquities are
given in a note.<a id="FNanchor_XI-39" href="#Footnote_XI-39" class="fnanchor">[XI-39]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS ON THE COLORADO CHIQUITO.</p>

<p class="p2">At a bend in the river, about forty miles above
the ruins last mentioned, are the remains of a
rectangular stone building, measuring one hundred
and twenty by three hundred and sixty feet, and
standing on an isolated sandstone hill. The walls
are mostly fallen, but some of the standing portions
are ten feet thick, and seem to contain small apartments.
Many pine timbers are scattered about in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_644">644</a></span>
good preservation, and two posts twelve feet in
height still remain standing.<a id="FNanchor_XI-40" href="#Footnote_XI-40" class="fnanchor">[XI-40]</a></p>

<p>Some twenty-five miles still farther up the Rio
Puerco flows into the Colorado Chiquito from the
north-east, and at the junction of the two streams
Möllhausen noticed some remains which he does not
describe.<a id="FNanchor_XI-41" href="#Footnote_XI-41" class="fnanchor">[XI-41]</a> Twelve miles up the Puerco valley, on
the banks of a small tributary, called Lithodendron
Creek, were scattered fragments of pottery, and remains
of stone houses, one of the walls extending
several feet below the present surface of the ground.
Still farther up the Puerco and five miles south of
the river, at Navajo Spring, scattered pottery and
arrow-heads are the only remaining trace of an aboriginal
settlement, no walls being visible. On a
neighboring hill, however, was noticed a circular depression
in the earth forty paces in diameter. The
cut from Möllhausen represents some of the aboriginal
inscriptions on Puerco River.<a id="FNanchor_XI-42" href="#Footnote_XI-42" class="fnanchor">[XI-42]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">REMAINS ON THE RIO ZUÑI.</p>

<p>Forty or fifty miles farther south-east, the Colorado
Chiquito receives the waters of the Rio Zuñi,
flowing from the north-east in a course nearly parallel
to that of the Puerco. Aboriginal inscriptions and
pictures are found on the sandstone cliffs which border
on the stream wherever a smooth surface is
presented, but no buildings occur for a distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645">645</a></span>
about fifty miles, until we come to within eight
miles of the Pueblo town of Zuñi, where the table-lands
about Arch Spring are covered with ruins,
which were seen, although not described, by Sitgreaves
and Whipple. All the ruins of the Zuñi
valley seem, however, to be of the same nature&mdash;stone
walls laid in mud mortar, and in a very dilapidated
condition. The cut from Whipple shows also
a sample of the rock-inscriptions about Arch Spring.<a id="FNanchor_XI-43" href="#Footnote_XI-43" class="fnanchor">[XI-43]</a>
Zuñi is a Pueblo town still inhabited, and I shall
have something further to say of it in connection
with the Pueblo towns of the Rio Grande and its
tributaries, for the purpose of comparing the inhabited
with the ruined structures.</p>

<p class="caption">Zuñi Vases.</p>
</div>

<p>Two or three miles south-east of Zuñi, on the
south side of the river, is an elevated level mesa,
about a mile in width, bounded on every side by a
precipitous descent of over a thousand feet to the
plain below. The mesa is covered with a growth of
cedar, and in one part are two sandstone pillars of
natural formation, which from certain points of view
seem to assume human forms. Among the cedars on
the mesa, "crumbling walls, from two to twelve feet
high, were crowded together in confused heaps over
several acres of ground." The walls were constructed
of small sandstone blocks laid in mud mortar, and
were about eighteen inches thick. They seemed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646">646</a></span>
however, to rest on more ancient ruins, the walls of
which were six feet in thickness. At various points
on the winding path, by which only the top can be
reached, there are stone battlements which guard the
passage. A supposed altar was found in a secluded
nook near the ruins, consisting of an oval excavation
seven feet long, with a vertical shaft two feet high at
one end, a flat rock, and a complicated arrangement
of posts, cords, feathers, marine shells, beads, and
sticks, only to be understood from a drawing, which I
do not reproduce because the whole altar so-called is
so evidently of modern origin and use. These ruins
are commonly called Old Zuñi, and were doubtless
inhabited when the Spaniards first came to the
country.<a id="FNanchor_XI-44" href="#Footnote_XI-44" class="fnanchor">[XI-44]</a> The cut from Whipple shows two vases
found at what is called a sacred spring near Zuñi.
Of the first the discoverer says: "the material is a
light-colored clay, tolerably well burnt, and ornamented
with lines and figures of a dark brown or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_647">647</a></span>
chocolate color. A vast amount of labor has been
spent on decorating the unique lip. A fine borderline
has been drawn along the edge and on both sides
of the deep embattled rim. Horned frogs and tadpoles
alternate on the inner surface of the turrets,
while one of the latter is represented on the outside
of each. Larger frogs or toads are portrayed within
the body of the vessel." One of these figures is presented
in the cut enlarged. The second vase is five
inches deep, ten inches in diameter at the widest
part, and eight inches at the lips. Both outer and
inner surface bear a white glazing, and there are four
projections of unknown use, one on each side. The
decorations are in amber color, and the horned or
tufted snakes, shown above the vase, are said to be
almost unique in America.<a id="FNanchor_XI-45" href="#Footnote_XI-45" class="fnanchor">[XI-45]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">OJO DEL PESCADO.</p>

<p class="p2">At and near some springs called Ojo del Pescado,
on the head-waters of this stream, some
twelve miles above Zuñi, there are at least four or
five ruined structures, or towns. They are similar
in character to the other ruins. Two of them near
the spring have an elliptical shape, as shown by the
lines of foundation-stones, and are from eight hundred
to a thousand feet in circumference. The houses
seem to have been built around the periphery, forming
a large interior court. These towns are so completely
in ruins that nothing can be ascertained of
the details of their construction, except their general
form, and the fact that they were built of stones
and mud. About a thousand yards down the river
from the springs are ruins covering a space one hundred
and fifty by two hundred yards, and in much
better preservation than those mentioned, though of
the same nature. The material was flat stones and
cement, and the walls are standing in places to the
height of two stories. Möllhausen tells us that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648">648</a></span>
the roofs and fire-places were still standing at the
time of his visit. Simpson describes a ruin as being
two miles below the spring, and which may possibly
be the same last mentioned. The buildings were
originally two stories high and built continuously
about a rectangular area three hundred by four hundred
feet. In the interior of the enclosed court was
seen a square estufa, twelve by eighteen feet, and
ten feet high, with the roof still perfect. The cut
shows some of the rock-inscriptions at Ojo del Pescado.<a id="FNanchor_XI-46" href="#Footnote_XI-46" class="fnanchor">[XI-46]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Plan of El Moro.</p>
</div>

<p>About eighteen miles south-east of the sources of
the Zuñi River, but belonging as properly in this valley
as any other, is a sandstone rock known as Inscription
Rock, or to the Spaniards as El Moro, from
its form. It is between two and three hundred feet
high, with steep sides, which on the north and east
are perpendicular, smooth, white, and covered near
the base with both Spanish and native inscriptions.
Specimens of the latter, as copied by Simpson, are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649">649</a></span>
shown in the cut. The former were all copied by the
same explorer, but of course have no connection with
the subject of this volume: they date back to 1606,
but make no reference to any town or ruins upon or
about the rock. The ascent to the summit is on the
south and is a difficult one. The cut shows a plan of
El Moro made by Möllhausen, the locality of the inscriptions
being at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The summit area is
divided by a deep ravine into two parts, on each of
which are found ruins of large edifices. Those on the
southern&mdash;or, according to Simpson, on the eastern&mdash;division,
B of the plan, form a rectangle measuring
two hundred and six by three hundred and seven
feet, standing in some places from six to eight feet
high. According to Simpson the walls agree with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650">650</a></span>
the cardinal points, but Whipple states the contrary.
The walls are faced with sandstone blocks six
by fourteen inches and from three to eight inches
thick, laid in mud-mortar so as to break joints; but
the bulk of the wall is a rubble of rough stones and
mud. Two ranges of rooms may be traced on the
north and west sides, and the rubbish indicates that
there were also some apartments in the interior court.
Two rooms measured each about seven by eight feet.
A circular estufa thirty-one feet in diameter was also
noticed, and there were cedar timbers found in connection
with the ruined walls; one piece, fifteen inches
long and four inches in diameter was found still in
place, and bore, according to Whipple, no signs of cutting
tools. The remains across the ravine, A of the
plan, are of similar nature and material, and the north
wall stands directly on the brink of a precipice, being
complete to a height of eight feet. There is a spring
furnishing but a small amount of water at the foot of
the cliff at <i>d</i>. Fragments of pottery are abundant
here as elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_XI-47" href="#Footnote_XI-47" class="fnanchor">[XI-47]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">RUINS OF CHELLY CAÑON.</p>

<p class="p2">This completes my account of remains on the Colorado
Chiquito, and I pass to the next and last tributary
of the Colorado within the territory covered by
this chapter&mdash;the San Juan, which flows in an eastwardly
course along the boundary line between Arizona
and New Mexico on the south, and Utah and
Colorado on the north. The valley of the main San
Juan has been but very slightly explored, but probably
contains extensive remains, judging from what
have been found on some of its tributaries. Padres
Dominguez and Escalante went in 1776 from Santa
Fé north-westward to Utah Lake, and noticed several
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_651">651</a></span>
ruins which it is impossible to locate, before crossing
the Colorado. I shall have occasion in the following
chapter to notice some important ruins lately discovered
on the northern tributaries of the San Juan, in
the southern part of Colorado and Utah.<a id="FNanchor_XI-48" href="#Footnote_XI-48" class="fnanchor">[XI-48]</a></p>

<p>The two chief tributaries of the San Juan from the
south are the Chelly and Chaco, flowing through deep
cañons in the heart of the Navajo country. On both
of these streams, particularly the latter, very important
ruins have been discovered and described by
Mr Simpson, who explored this region in 1849.</p>

<p>The Chelly cañon for a distance of about twenty-five
miles is from one hundred and fifty to nine hundred
feet wide, from three hundred to five hundred
feet deep, and its sides are almost perpendicular.
Simpson explored the cañon for eight miles from its
mouth, which does not correspond with the mouth of
the river. In a branch cañon of a character similar
to that of the main stream he found several small
habitations formed by building walls of stone and
mortar in front of overhanging rocks. Some four
miles up the main cañon he saw on a shelf fifty
feet high and only accessible by means of ladders a
small ruin of stone, much like those on the Chaco yet
to be described. Seven miles from the mouth
another ruin was discovered on the north side as shown
in the cut. It was built partly on the bottom of the
cañon, and partly like the one last mentioned, on a
shelf fifty feet high with perpendicular sides. The
walls measure forty-five by a hundred and forty-five
feet, are about eighteen feet high in their present
state, and are built of sandstone and mortar, having
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652">652</a></span>
square openings or windows. A circular estufa was
also found in connection with these cliff-dwellings.
Fragments of pottery were not lacking, and specimens
were sketched by Mr Simpson.<a id="FNanchor_XI-49" href="#Footnote_XI-49" class="fnanchor">[XI-49]</a></p>

<p>Eastward from the Chelly, at a distance of about
a hundred miles, is the Chaco, a parallel tributary of
the San Juan, on which are found ruins perhaps the
most remarkable in the New Mexican group. Lieut.
Simpson is the only one who has explored this valley,
or at least who has left a record of his exploration.
The ruins are eleven in number, situated with one
exception on the north bank of the stream, within a
distance of twenty-five miles in latitude 36° and longitude
108°.</p>

</div>

<p>The cut shows a general view of the ruin called by
the guide Pueblo Pintado, the first one discovered in
coming from the south. The name of this ruin, like
those of the others, is doubtless of modern origin,
being Spanish, and there is little reason to believe
that the native names of some of the others are those
originally applied to the inhabited towns. The material
of all the buildings is a fine hard gray sandstone,
to which in some instances exposure to the air
has imparted a reddish hue. The blocks are cut very
thin, rarely exceeding three inches in thickness.
They are laid without mortar very carefully, so as to
break joints, and the chinks between the larger
blocks are filled with stone plates, sometimes not over
one fourth of an inch thick. In one instance, the
Pueblo Peñasco Blanco, stones of different thickness
are laid, in alternate layers, producing the appearance
of a kind of mosaic work, executed with great care
and skill, and forming a very smooth surface. The
backing and filling of the walls are of irregular and
various sized blocks laid in mud, no trace of lime
being discoverable. The wall of the Pueblo Pintado
was found by excavation to extend at least two feet
below the surface of the ground. The walls are between
two and three feet thick at the base, but diminish
towards the top by a jog of a few inches on
the inside at each successive story. The walls of the
Pueblo Pintado are still standing in some parts to
the height of twenty-five to thirty feet, and are shown
by the marks of floor timbers to have had at least
three stories. The flooring was supported by unhewn
beams from six to eleven inches in diameter&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654">654</a></span>
uniform in the same room&mdash;stretching across from
wall to wall as in the Gila ruins. Over these beams
were placed smaller transverse sticks, which in the
Pueblo Pintado seem to have been placed some little
distance apart; but in some other ruins where the
flooring remained perfect, the transverse sticks were
laid close together, the chinks were filled with small
stones, and the whole covered with cedar strips, although
there was evidence that a coating of mud or
mortar was used in some instances; and there was
one room where the floor was of smooth cedar boards
seven inches wide and three fourths of an inch thick,
squarely cut at the sides and ends, and apparently
worn smooth by the friction of flat stones. The
beams generally bore marks of having been cut off
by the use of some blunt instrument. The cut illustrates

<p class="sidenote">THE PUEBLO BONITO.</p>

<p>The ground plan of the Chaco structures shows
three tiers&mdash;but in one case at least four tiers&mdash;of
apartments built round three sides of a courtyard,
which is generally rectangular, in some cases has
curved corners, and in one building&mdash;the Peñasco
Blanco&mdash;approximates to the form of a circle. The
fourth side of the court is in some ruins open, and in
others enclosed by a wall extending in a curve from
one extremity of the building to the other. The following
cuts show the ground plans of two of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_656">656</a></span>
ruins, the Pueblo Hungo Pavie, 'crooked nose,' and
Pueblo Bonito. The circumference of five of these
buildings is respectively eight hundred and seventy-two,
seven hundred, seventeen hundred, thirteen hundred,
and thirteen hundred feet; the number of rooms
still traceable on the ground floor of the same buildings
is seventy-two, ninety-nine, one hundred and
twelve, one hundred and twenty-four, and one hundred
and thirty-nine. These apartments are from
five feet square to eight by fourteen feet. A room in
the Pueblo Chettro Kettle was seven and a half by
fourteen feet, and ten feet high. The walls were
plastered with a red mud, and several square or rectangular
niches of unknown use were noticed. The
supporting beams of the ceiling were two in number,
and the transverse poles were tied at their ends with
some wooden fibre, and covered with a kind of cedar
lathing. Ropes hung from the timbers. A room in
the Pueblo Bonito is shown in the cut.</p>

<p class="caption">Interior of Room&mdash;Pueblo Bonito.</p>
</div>

<p>This room is unplastered, and the sides are constructed
in the same style as the outer walls. The
transverse poles are very small, about an inch in
diameter, laid close together, very regular, and resemble
barked willow. It was another room in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_657">657</a></span>
this ruin which had the smooth boards in connection
with its ceiling.<a id="FNanchor_XI-50" href="#Footnote_XI-50" class="fnanchor">[XI-50]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_658">658</a></span></p>

<p>The doors by which the rooms communicate with
each other and with the courtyard are very small,
many of them not exceeding two and a half feet
square. There are no doors whatever in the outer
walls, and no windows except in the upper stories.
The larger size of the windows and of the inner doors
indicate that the rooms of the upper stories were
larger than below. In some cases the walls corresponding
to the second or third stories had no windows.
In one case lower story windows were found
walled up. The tops, or lintels, of the doors and
windows were in some cases stone slabs, in others
small timbers bound together with withes, and in a
few they are reported to have been formed by overlapping
stones very much like the Yucatan arch; a
specimen is shown in the cut.</p>

<p class="caption">Arch of Overlapping Stones.</p>
</div>

<p>The highest walls still standing at the time of
Simpson's visit had floor-timbers, or their marks, for
four stories, but it is not impossible that some of the
buildings may have had originally five or six stories.
The outer walls were in every case perpendicular to
their full height, showing that the houses were not
built in receding terraces, or stories, on the outside,
as is the case with many of the inhabited Pueblo
towns, and with the Casa Grande on the Gila. There
can be no doubt that they were so terraced on the interior
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_659">659</a></span>
or court; at least in no instance were the inner
walls sufficiently high to indicate a different arrangement,
and it is hardly possible that all the ranges
were of the same height, leaving without light most
of the thousand rooms which they would contain if
built on such a plan. There were no traces of stairways
or chimneys seen. The whole number of apartments
in the Pueblo Bonito, supposing it to have
been built on the terrace plan, must have been six
hundred and forty-one. The cut on the next page
shows a restoration of one of the Chaco ruins, taken
from Mr Baldwin's work, and modeled after a similar
one by Mr Kern, a companion of Simpson, although
Mr Kern made an error of one story in the height.
I have no doubt of the general accuracy of this restoration,
and it may be regarded as nearly certain that
access to the upper rooms was gained from the court
by means of ladders, each story forming a platform before
the doors of the one next above.</p>

<p>Each ruin has from one to seven circular structures,
called estufas in the inhabited Pueblo towns, sunk in
the ground and walled with stone. Several of these
are shown in the two ground plans that have been
given. They occur both in the courtyards and underneath
the rooms. Some were divided into compartments,
and one, in the Pueblo Bonito, was sixty
feet in diameter and twelve feet deep, being built
in two, and possibly three, stories.</p>

<p>Near some of the larger buildings are smaller detached
ruins, of which no particular description is
given. In one place there is an excavation in the
side of a cliff, enclosed by a front wall of stone and
mortar. In another locality there is an isolated elliptical
enclosure of stone and mortar, eight by sixteen
feet, and divided into two compartments. Near one
of the ruins, in the northern wall of the cañon, about
twelve feet from the base, are three circular holes two
feet in diameter, with smaller ones between them, all
in a horizontal line, with a vertical line of still smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_660"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_661">661</a></span>
holes leading up the cliff to one of the larger ones.
Mr Simpson was unable to explore this singular excavation,
and its use is unknown; it may be a room or
fortress excavated from the solid rock. There are
also some hieroglyphics on the face of the cliff under
the holes. The quarries which furnished the stone
for some of the buildings were found, but no description
of them is given. Hieroglyphics on boulders
were found at a few points. The pottery found
among the Chaco ruins is illustrated by the cut.
Black and red seem to be the only colors employed.
The Chaco cañon, although wider than that of the
Chelly, is bounded by precipitous sides, and the ruins
are generally near the base of the cliff. The Pueblo
Pintado is built on a knoll twenty or thirty feet high,
about three hundred yards from the river. The buildings
do not exactly face the cardinal points.<a id="FNanchor_XI-51" href="#Footnote_XI-51" class="fnanchor">[XI-51]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_662">662</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO REMAINS ON THE RIO GRANDE.</p>

<p>I now come to the last division of the present
group, the perpendicular of our triangle, the Rio
Grande del Norte and its tributaries. This valley,
the New Mexico proper of the Spaniards, when first
visited in the sixteenth century, was thickly inhabited
by an agricultural semi-civilized people, dwelling
in towns of stone and mud houses several stories in
height. Respecting the number, names, and exact
locality of these towns the early accounts are somewhat
vague, but many of them can be accurately
traced by means of an examination of authorities
which would be out of place here. From the first
discovery by Cabeza de Vaca, Marco de Niza, and
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, the general history
of the country is clear; and we still find the same
semi-civilized people living in similar towns under
similar institutions, although they, like the towns in
which they live, are greatly reduced in number.
Some of the inhabited Pueblo towns are known by
name, location, and history, to be identical with those
which so excited the admiration of the Spaniards;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_663">663</a></span>
and there is every reason to believe that all are so,
except a few that may have been built during the
Spanish domination. The inhabited Pueblo towns,
or those inhabited during the nineteenth century, are
about twenty in number, although authors disagree
on this point, some calling Pueblos what others say
are merely Mexican towns; but the distinction is not
important for my present purpose.<a id="FNanchor_XI-52" href="#Footnote_XI-52" class="fnanchor">[XI-52]</a> The important
fact is, that the Spaniard found no race of people in
New Mexico which has since become extinct, nor any
class of towns or buildings that differed from the
Pueblo towns still inhabited.</p>

<p>Besides the towns still inhabited there are many
of precisely the same materials and architecture,
which are in ruins. Such are Pecos, Quivira, Valverde,
San Lázaro, San Marcos, San Cristóbal,
Socorro, Senacu, Abó, Quarra, Rita, Poblazon,
old San Felipe, and old Zuñi. Some of these were
abandoned by the natives at a very recent date;
some have ruined Spanish buildings among the aboriginal
structures; some may be historically identified
with the towns conquered by the first European
visitors. These facts, together with the absence of
any mention of ruins by the first explorers, and the
well-known diminution of the Pueblos in numbers
and power, make it perfectly safe to affirm that the
ruins all belong to the same class, the same people,
and about the same epoch as the inhabited towns.
This conclusion is of some importance since it renders
it useless to examine carefully each ruin, and the
documents bearing on its individual history, and enables
the reader to form a perfectly clear idea of all
the many structures by carefully studying a few.</p>

<p>While the Pueblo towns cannot be regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_664">664</a></span>
objects of great mystery, as the work of a race that
has disappeared, or as a station of the Aztecs while on
their way southward, yet they are properly treated
as antiquities, since they were doubtless built by the
native races before they come in contact with the
Spaniards. They occupy the same position with respect
to the subject of this volume as the remains in
Anáhuac, excepting perhaps Cholula and Teotihuacan;
or rather they have the same importance that
the city of Tlacopan would have, had the Spaniards
permitted that city to stand in possession of its
native inhabitants.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PUEBLO TOWNS OF NEW MEXICO.</p>

<p>An account of the Pueblo buildings has been given
in another volume of this work,<a id="FNanchor_XI-53" href="#Footnote_XI-53" class="fnanchor">[XI-53]</a> and I cannot do
better here than to quote from good authorities a description
of the principal towns, both inhabited and
in ruins. Of Taos Mr Abert says, "One of the
northern forks of the Taos river, on issuing from the
mountains, forms a delightful nook, which the Indians
early selected as a permanent residence. By gradual
improvement, from year to year, it has finally become
one of the most formidable of the artificial strongholds
of New Mexico. On each side of the little
mountain stream is one of those immense 'adobe'
structures, which rises by successive steps until an
irregular pyramidal building, seven stories high, presents
an almost impregnable tower. These, with the
church and some few scattering houses, make up the
village. The whole is surrounded by an adobe wall,
strengthened in some places by rough palisades, the
different parts so arranged, for mutual defence, as to
have elicited much admiration for the skill of the
untaught engineers." Of the same town Davis says,
"It is the best sample of the ancient mode of building.
Here there are two large houses three hundred or four
hundred feet in length, and about one hundred and
fifty feet wide at the base. They are situated upon
opposite sides of a small creek, and in ancient times
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_665">665</a></span>
are said to have been connected by a bridge. They
are five and six stories high, each story receding from
the one below it, and thus forming a structure terraced
from top to bottom. Each story is divided into
numerous little compartments, the outer tiers of rooms
being lighted by small windows in the sides, while
those in the interior of the building are dark, and are
principally used as store-rooms.... The only means of
entrance is through a trap-door in the roof, and you
ascend, from story to story, by means of ladders upon
the outside, which are drawn up at night." The same
writer gives the following cut of Taos.<a id="FNanchor_XI-54" href="#Footnote_XI-54" class="fnanchor">[XI-54]</a></p>

<img src="images/i665.jpg" width="538" height="186" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Pueblo of Taos.</p>
</div>

<p>The houses of Laguna are "built of stone, roughly
laid in mortar, and, on account of the color of the mortar,
with which they are also faced, they present a
dirty yellowish clay aspect. They have windows in the
basement as well as upper stories; selenite, as usual,
answers the purpose of window-lights."<a id="FNanchor_XI-55" href="#Footnote_XI-55" class="fnanchor">[XI-55]</a></p>

<p>"High on a lofty rock of sandstone ... sits the
city of Acoma. On the northern side of the rock,
the rude boreas blasts have heaped up the sand, so as
to form a practical ascent for some distance; the rest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_666">666</a></span>
of the way is through solid rock. At one place a
singular opening, or narrow way, is formed between a
huge square tower of rock and the perpendicular face
of the cliff. Then the road winds round like a spiral
stair way, and the Indians have, in some way, fixed
logs of wood in the rock, radiating from a vertical
axis, like steps.... At last we reached the top of the
rock, which was nearly level, and contains about sixty
acres. Here we saw a large church, and several continuous
blocks of buildings, containing sixty or seventy
houses in each block, (the wall at the side that
faced outwards was unbroken, and had no windows
until near the top: the houses were three stories
high). In front each story retreated back as it ascended,
so as to leave a platform along the whole front
of the story: these platforms are guarded by parapet
walls about three feet high." Ladders are used for
first and second stories but there are steps in the
wall to reach the roof.<a id="FNanchor_XI-56" href="#Footnote_XI-56" class="fnanchor">[XI-56]</a> Mr Gregg tells us that San
Felipe is on "the very verge of a precipice several
hundred feet high," but Simpson states that "neither
it nor Sandia is as purely Indian in the style of its
buildings as the other pueblos."<a id="FNanchor_XI-57" href="#Footnote_XI-57" class="fnanchor">[XI-57]</a></p>

<p>Santo Domingo "is laid out in streets running
perpendicularly to the Rio Grande. The houses are
constructed of <i>adobes</i>, (blocks of mud, of greater or
less dimensions, sun-dried;) are two stories in height,
the upper one set retreatingly on the lower, so as to
make the superior covering of the lower answer for
a terrace or platform for the upper; and have roofs
which are nearly flat. These roofs are made first of
transverse logs which pitch very slightly outward,
and are sustained at their ends by the side walls of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_667">667</a></span>
the building; on these, a layer of slabs or brush is
laid; a layer of bark or straw is then laid on these;
and covering the whole is a layer of mud of six or
more inches in thickness. The height of the stories
is about eight or nine feet."<a id="FNanchor_XI-58" href="#Footnote_XI-58" class="fnanchor">[XI-58]</a></p>

<p>"On my visit to the pueblo of Tesuque we entered
a large square, around which the dwellings are erected
close together, so as to present outwardly an unbroken
line of wall to the height of three stories.
Viewed from the inner square it presents the appearance
of a succession of terraces with doors and
windows opening upon them.... This general description
is applicable to all the Pueblo villages, however
they may differ in size, position, and nature of
the ground&mdash;some being on bluffs, some on mesas,
and most of those in the valley of the Rio Grande
on level ground."<a id="FNanchor_XI-59" href="#Footnote_XI-59" class="fnanchor">[XI-59]</a></p>

<p>Zuñi, "like Santo Domingo, is built terrace-shaped&mdash;each
story, of which there are generally
three, being smaller, laterally, so that one story
answers in part for the platform of the one above
it. It, however, is far more compact than Santo Domingo&mdash;its
streets being narrow, and in places presenting
the appearance of tunnels, or covered ways,
on account of the houses extending at these places
over them. The houses are generally built of stone,
plastered with mud,"&mdash;has an adobe Catholic church.<a id="FNanchor_XI-60" href="#Footnote_XI-60" class="fnanchor">[XI-60]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE MOQUI TOWNS.</p>

<p class="p2">The seven Moqui towns in Arizona, situated in an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_668">668</a></span>
isolated mountainous region about midway between
the Colorado Chiquito and the Chelly cañon, in latitude
35° 50´, and longitude 110° 30´, are very similar
to the Pueblo towns of the Rio Grande. They were
probably visited by the earliest Spanish explorers,
and have a claim to as great an antiquity as any in
the whole region. Lieut. Ives visited the Moquis in
1858, and his description is the best extant; from it
I quote as follows: "I discovered with a spy-glass
two of the Moqui towns, eight or ten miles distant,
upon the summit of a high bluff overhanging the
opposite side of the valley. They were built close
to the edge of the precipice.... The outlines of the
closely-packed structures looked in the distance like
the towers and battlements of a castle." "The
face of the bluff, upon the summit of which the
town was perched, was cut up and irregular. We
were led through a passage that wound among some
low hillocks of sand and rock that extended half-way
to the top.... A small plateau, in the centre of
which was a circular reservoir, fifty feet in diameter,
lined with masonry, and filled with pure cold water.
The basin was fed from a pipe connecting with some
source of supply upon the summit of the mesa....
Continuing to ascend we came to another reservoir,
smaller, but of more elaborate construction and finish....
Between the two the face of the bluff had been
ingeniously converted into terraces. These were
faced with neat masonry, and contained gardens, each
surrounded with a raised edge so as to retain water
upon the surface. Pipes from the reservoirs permitted
them at any time to be irrigated. Peach trees
were growing upon the terraces and in the hollows
below. A long flight of stone steps, with sharp turns
that could easily be defended, was built into the face of
the precipice, and led from the upper reservoir to the
foot of the town." "The town is nearly square, and
surrounded by a stone wall fifteen feet high, the top
of which forms a landing extending around the whole.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_669">669</a></span>
Flights of stone steps led from the first to a second
landing, upon which the doors of the house open."
"The room was fifteen feet by ten; the walls were made
of adobes; the partitions of substantial beams; the
floor laid with clay. In one corner were a fireplace and
chimney. Everything was clean and tidy. Skins,
bows and arrows, quivers, antlers, blankets, articles of
clothing and ornament, were hanging from the walls
or arranged upon shelves. Vases, flat dishes, and
gourds filled with meal or water were standing along
one side of the room. At the other end was a trough
divided into compartments, in each of which was a
sloping stone slab two or three feet square for grinding
corn upon. In a recess of an inner room was
piled a goodly store of corn in the ear."</p>

<p>"We learned that there were seven towns; that the
name of that which we were visiting was Mooshahneh.
A second smaller town was half a mile distant;
two miles westward was a third.... Five or six
miles to the north-east a bluff was pointed out as the
location of three others, and we were informed that the
last of the seven, Oraybe, was still further distant, on
the trail towards the great river." "Each pueblo is
built around a rectangular court, in which we suppose
are the springs that furnish the supply to the reservoirs.
The exterior walls, which are of stone, have
no openings, and would have to be scaled or battered
down before access could be gained to the
interior. The successive stories are set back, one
behind the other. The lower rooms are reached
through trap-doors from the first landing. The
houses are three rooms deep, and open upon the interior
court." "He led the way to the east of the
bluff on which Oraybe stands. Eight or nine miles
brought the train to an angle formed by two faces of
the precipice. At the foot was a reservoir, and a
broad road winding up the steep ascent. On either
side the bluffs were cut into terraces, and laid out
into gardens similar to those seen at Mooshahneh,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_670">670</a></span>
and, like them, irrigated from an upper reservoir.
The whole reflected great credit upon Moquis ingenuity
and skill in the department of engineering.
The walls of the terraces and reservoirs were of
partially dressed stone, well and strongly built, and
the irrigating pipes conveniently arranged. The little
gardens were neatly laid out."<a id="FNanchor_XI-61" href="#Footnote_XI-61" class="fnanchor">[XI-61]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Thus we see that a universal peculiarity of the
Pueblo towns is that the lower stories are entered by
ladders by way of the roof. Their location varies
from the low valley to the elevated mesa and precipitous
cliff; their height from one to seven stories,
two stories and one terrace being a common form.
Most of them recede in successive terraces at each
story from the outside, but Tesuque, and perhaps a
few others, are terraced from the interior court. The
building material is sometimes adobe, but generally
stone plastered with mud. The exact construction of
the walls is nowhere stated, but they are presumably
built of roughly squared blocks of the stone most
accessible, laid in mud. With each town is connected
an estufa, or public council-chamber and place
of worship. This is in some cases partly subterranean,
and its walls are covered with rude paintings
in bright colors.<a id="FNanchor_XI-62" href="#Footnote_XI-62" class="fnanchor">[XI-62]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_671">671</a></span>
Pecos was formerly one of the most important, and
was still inhabited in the early part of the present
century. The cut copied from Emory for Mr Baldwin's
work, represents a portion of the ruins, which
include Spanish and aboriginal structures, both of
adobe. Emory noticed large well-hewn timbers.
Davis says the ruins of the village cover two or
three hundred yards, and include large blocks of
stone, square and oblong, weighing over a ton, with
marks of having been laid in mortar. Hughes
speaks of the traces of a stone wall eight feet high,
which once surrounded this Pueblo town. Kit Carson
told Mr Meline that he found the town still
inhabited in 1826. It was here that in former times
was kept burning the everlasting fire which formed
part of the religious rites in honor of their deity, or,
according to the modern account, of Montezuma.
There is no evidence, however, that the aborigines in
ancient times had any deity, or monarch of that
name; it is quite certain that they did not hear of
the Aztec monarch Montezuma many centuries before
he began to reign; just possible that they did
hear of his fame a few years before the Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_672">672</a></span>
came to New Mexico; but altogether probable that
they first heard the name of Montezuma, of the
Aztec people, and of their former migration southward,
from the Spaniards themselves, or their native
companions.<a id="FNanchor_XI-63" href="#Footnote_XI-63" class="fnanchor">[XI-63]</a></p>

<p>With the Quivira located by Thomas Gage and
other early writers and map-makers, "on the most
Western part of America just over against Tartary,"
as with the great city of Quivira which Francisco
Vasquez de Coronado sought and has been popularly
supposed to have found, I have at present nothing to
do. It should be noted, however, that the latter
Quivira was not one of the Pueblo towns of the Rio
Grande, but a town of wigwams on the plains in the
far north-east. The ruined town of Quivira or Gran
Quivira, east of the Rio Grande, entirely distinct from
that of Coronado, includes, like Pecos, a Spanish
church among its ruins. The buildings are of hewn
stone and of great extent. Gregg speaks of an aqueduct
leading to the mountains eight or ten miles distant,
the nearest water. This town was very likely,
like many others, ruined at the revolt of 1680. Abó,
Quarra, Laguna, and the rest, present no new features.
There are, moreover, on the Puerco River&mdash;a
tributary of the Rio Grande, and not that of the
Colorado Chiquito already mentioned&mdash;many traces
of Pueblo buildings which have no definite names.<a id="FNanchor_XI-64" href="#Footnote_XI-64" class="fnanchor">[XI-64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The cut shows some rock-inscriptions copied by
Froebel in the valley of the Rio Grande. In the
Sierra de los Mimbres, towards the source of the Gila,
are some old copper mines, and connected with them
an adobe fort with round towers at the corners, but I
do not know that these works have ever been considered
of aboriginal origin. In a newspaper I find the
remarkable statement that "from the volcanic cones
of the Cerrillos was furnished, a great part, if not all,
the Chalchiuite, so much worn for ornament, and so
highly prized by the ancient Mexicans.... The ancient
excavations made in search of it are now distinctly
visible, and seem to have been carried to the
depth of two hundred feet or more."<a id="FNanchor_XI-65" href="#Footnote_XI-65" class="fnanchor">[XI-65]</a></p>

<p>The ruins of Old Zuñi have already been described,
and there is no reason to doubt that both these and
the other remains on the Zuñi River, represent towns
that were inhabited when the Spaniards first came
northward. Indeed it is almost certain that they, together
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_674">674</a></span>
with the Pueblo town of Zuñi, represent
Coronado's famous 'seven cities' of Cíbola. Most
writers have so decided, as Gallatin, Squier, Whipple,
Turner, Kern, and Simpson.<a id="FNanchor_XI-66" href="#Footnote_XI-66" class="fnanchor">[XI-66]</a> The course and distance
of Coronado's march from the Gila agrees more
exactly with Zuñi than with any other town; the
location of the 'seven cities' within four leagues together,
in a very narrow valley between steep banks,
as also their position with respect to the Rio del Lino,
Colorado Chiquito, correspond very well with the
Zuñi ruins; Coronado's Granada, on a high bluff, with
a "narrow winding way," was quite probably Old
Zuñi; Cíbola is said to have been the first town
reached in coming across the desert from the south-west,
and the last left in returning; the positions of
Tusayan, a province of seven villages, five days' journey
north-west from Cíbola, and of Acuco, five days
eastward, agree very well with the location of the
Moqui towns and of Acoma with respect to Zuñi.
Finally we have Espejo's statement that he visited
the province of Zuñi, twenty-five leagues west of
Acoma; that it was called Zuñi by the natives and
Cíbola by the Spaniards; that Coronado had been
there; and that he found there not only crosses and
other emblems of Christianity, but three Christians
even. Coronado left three men at Cíbola, and their
statements to Espejo respecting the identity of Cíbola
and Zuñi, must be regarded as conclusive.<a id="FNanchor_XI-67" href="#Footnote_XI-67" class="fnanchor">[XI-67]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GENERAL RÉSUMÉ.</p>

<p>New Mexican antiquities, divided as at the beginning
of the chapter into six classes, may be briefly
considered, en résumé, as follows: 1st. "Remains of
ancient stone and adobe buildings in all stages of
disintegration, from standing walls with roofs and
floors, to shapeless heaps of débris, or simple lines of
foundation-stones." This first class of remains has
received most attention in the preceding pages, and
little need be said in addition. It has been noted
that adobe is the material used almost exclusively in
the Gila and other southern valleys, as in Chihuahua,
while further north stone is preferred. The most important
fact to be noted is that all the ruins, without
exception, are precisely identical in plan, architecture,
and material with the Pueblo towns now inhabited or
known to have been inhabited since the coming of the
Spaniards. Many of them, particularly those of the
Chaco cañon, may have been much grander structures
and have displayed a higher degree of art than the
modern towns, but they all belong to the same class
of buildings.</p>

<p>2d. "Anomalous structures of stone or earth, the
purpose of which, either by reason of their advanced
state of ruin, or of the comparatively slight attention
given them by travelers, is not apparent." Such
remains, which have been described as far as possible
wherever they have appeared, are: I. Fortifications,
like the stone enclosures on the Pueblo Creek and
head-waters of the Rio Verde; and the battlements
guarding the path of ascent to Old Zuñi. Many of
the ruined towns were, moreover, effectually fortified
by the natural position in which they were built. II.
Mound-like structures and elevations. These include
the low terraced pyramid reported on the Gila near
the Casa Grande, and another of like nature on the
north side of the river; the shapeless heaps of earth
and stones in the Gila and Salinas valleys, most of
which are doubtless the remains of fallen walls, but
some of which may possibly have a different origin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_676">676</a></span>
and design; and some small heaps of loose stones on
the Gila at the mouth of the Santo Domingo. It is
noticeable that no burial mounds, of so common occurrence
in many parts of America, have been found
here; and no pyramids or mounds presumably connected
in any way with religious rites, indeed, nothing
of the nature of temples or altars, save the
estufas still in common use. III. Excavations.
These are, a reservoir with stone walls measuring
forty by sixty yards, reported by the early writers
near the Casa Grande on the Gila; a circular depression
forty paces in diameter on the north bank of the
Gila, and a similar one at Navajo Spring near the
Rio Puerco of the West; a triangular depression at
the mouth of the Santo Domingo; quarries of sandstone
near some of the Chaco ruins, and pits in the
Salinas, whence the earth for building is supposed
to have been taken; and the circular holes that penetrate
the cañon walls of the Chaco. IV. Enclosures
for various or unknown purposes. Such is the circular
enclosure a hundred yards in circumference near
the Casa Grande, and another north of the river; the
structure indefinitely reported as a labyrinth up the
Gila from the Casa Grande; a small round enclosure
on the Salado; an elliptical enclosure of stone and
mortar, eight by sixteen feet, and divided into two
compartments, in the Chaco cañon; and the large
and irregular lines of foundation-stones in the Gila
Valley above the San Pedro. It will be observed
that there is very little of the mysterious connected
with these remains of the second class, and a great
part of that little would probably disappear as a result
of a more careful exploration.</p>

<p>3d. "Traces of aboriginal agriculture, in the shape
of acequias and zanjas, or irrigating canals and
ditches." Such remains have been noticed in connection
with many of the ruins, particularly in the
south, and require no further remarks. So far as
described, they are nothing but simple ditches dug in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_677">677</a></span>
the surface of the ground, of varying depth and
length. The earlier reports of canals with walled
sides are very probably unfounded.</p>

<img src="images/i677.jpg" width="170" height="254" alt="" />
<p class="caption">New Mexican Stone Axes.</p>
</div>

<p>4th. "Implements and ornaments." These are not
numerous, include no articles of any metal whatever,
and do not differ materially from articles now in use
among the Pueblo Indians. Such relics have been
found scattered among the débris of the fallen walls,
and not taken from regular excavations; consequently
no absolute proof exists that they are the work of
the builders, though there can be little room for
doubt on that point. The wandering tribes that
have occupied the country in modern times are much
more likely to have sought for and carried away
relics of the original inhabitants, than to have deposited
among the ruins articles made by the modern
Pueblo Indians. A detailed account of each relic
would be useless, but among the articles that have
been found are included,&mdash;I. Implements of stone.
Metates, or corn-grinders, generally broken, were found
at various points on the Gila, Salado, and among
the ruins near Pecos. Stone axes, are shown in the
cut from Whipple, of which No. 4 was found on the
Salado, where implements called hoes, and a stone
pestle, are also reported. A stone axe was also found
on the Colorado Chiquito. Arrow-heads of obsidian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_678">678</a></span>
were picked up at Old Zuñi, on the Colorado Chiquito,
on the Rio Puerco of the west, and at
Inscription Rock; of carnelian on the Colorado
Chiquito; of agate and jasper on the Rio Puerco;
and of quartz near Pecos and on Pueblo Creek.
Ross Browne heard of bone awls having been dug
up at the Casa Grande. II. Ornaments. Sea-shells
were found at the Casa Grande, on the north bank of
the Gila, and in the Salado valley; also on the Gila,
a bead of blue marble finely turned, an inch and a
quarter long; and another bead of the size of a hen's
egg; also a painted stone not described, and a beaver's
tooth. Several green stones, like amethysts, were
found on the Salado; fragments of quartz crystal at
the Casa Grande; of agate and obsidian among the
Gila mines; and of obsidian on Pueblo Creek. Clay
balls from the size of bullets to grape-shot, many of
them stuck together, are reported on doubtful authority.<a id="FNanchor_XI-68" href="#Footnote_XI-68" class="fnanchor">[XI-68]</a></p>

<p>5th. Pottery, the most abundant class of relics,
found strewn over the ground in the vicinity of every
ruin in this group. It is always in fragments, no
whole article of undoubted antiquity having ever
been found. This is natural enough, perhaps, since
only the surface has been examined, and the roaming
tribes of Indians would not be likely to leave anything
of use or value; excavation may in the future
bring to light whole specimens. But although the
absence of whole vessels is not strange, the presence
of fragments in so great abundance is very remarkable,
since no such tendency to their accumulation is
noticed about the inhabited Pueblo towns. It would
seem as if the inhabitants, forced to abandon their
houses in haste, had deliberately broken all their very
large stock of earthen ware, either to prevent its
falling into the hands of enemies, or from some superstitious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_679">679</a></span>
custom. The fragments are very like one to
another in all parts of the New Mexican region, and
in quality and ornamentation nearly identical with
the ware still manufactured and used by the Pueblos.
It has been noticed, however, that the older pottery
is superior generally in material and workmanship to
the modern; and also in the southern valleys it is
found painted on the inside as well as outside, contrary
as is said to the present usage. Very few fragments
show anything like glazing. The painted
ornamentation consists in most instances of stripes or
angular, more rarely of curved, lines, in black, white,
and red. Painted representations of any definite objects,
animate or inanimate, are of very rare occurrence.
Some specimens are, however, not painted,
but decorated with considerable skill by means of
raised or indented figures. I have given cuts of
many specimens, and the thirty-five figures on the
next page from different localities will suffice to explain
the nature and uniformity of New Mexican pottery.<a id="FNanchor_XI-69" href="#Footnote_XI-69" class="fnanchor">[XI-69]</a></p>

<p class="caption">New Mexican Pottery.</p>
</div>

<p>6th. "Painted or engraved figures on cliffs, boulders,
and the sides of natural caverns." These figures
have been mentioned whenever they occurred,
and some of them illustrated. There are additional
paintings in a rocky pass between Albuquerque and
Laguna, mentioned and copied by Möllhausen, and
both paintings and sculptures in Texas at Sierra Waco,
thirty miles east of El Paso, and at Rocky Dell
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_680">680</a></span>
Creek, in lat. 35°, 30´, long. 102°, 30´.<a id="FNanchor_XI-70" href="#Footnote_XI-70" class="fnanchor">[XI-70]</a> In another
volume of this work,<a id="FNanchor_XI-71" href="#Footnote_XI-71" class="fnanchor">[XI-71]</a> something has been said of
hieroglyphic development, of the different classes of
picture-records, and their respective value. The New
Mexican rock-inscriptions and paintings, such of them
as are not mere idle sketches executed without purpose
by the natives to while away the time, belong to
the lower classes of representative and symbolic picture-writing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_681">681</a></span>
and are utterly inadequate to preserve any
definite record far beyond the generation that executed
them. Most of them had a meaning to the artist and
his tribe at the time they were made; it is safe to
suppose that no living being to-day can interpret their
meaning, and that they never will be understood.
The similar figures painted on the walls of modern
estufas,<a id="FNanchor_XI-72" href="#Footnote_XI-72" class="fnanchor">[XI-72]</a> the natives will not, probably cannot, explain.
Mr Froebel, in opposition to Mr Bartlett's
theory that the figures are meaningless, very justly
says: "Many circumstances tend to disprove that
these characters were originally nothing but the results
of an early attempt at art. In the first place,
the similarity of the style, in localities a thousand
miles apart, and its extreme peculiarity, preclude
every idea of an accidental similarity. One cannot
imagine how the same recurring figures should have
been used over and over again, unless they had a conventional
character, and were intended to express
something."<a id="FNanchor_XI-73" href="#Footnote_XI-73" class="fnanchor">[XI-73]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">I conclude this division of my work by a few general
remarks, embodying such conclusions respecting
the New Mexican ruins as may be drawn from the
ruins themselves, without reference to the mass of
speculation, tradition, and so-called history, that has
confused the whole subject since first the missionary
padres visited and wrote of this region, and sought
diligently, and of course successfully, for traditions respecting
the Asiatic origin of the Americans, and the
southern migration of the Aztecs from the mysterious
regions of the Californias to Anáhuac. These conclusions
are not lengthy or numerous, and apply with
equal force to the Casas Grandes of Chihuahua, outside
of the geographical limits of this chapter.</p>

<p>1. The ruined structures offer but little internal
evidence of their age. There is not even the slight
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_682">682</a></span>
aid of forest growth found in nearly all other parts of
America. The different buildings show very different
degrees of dilapidation it is true, but to what extent
in each case the ravages of time have been
assisted by the roaming Apaches and other savages,
it is impossible to decide. The Casas Grandes of
Chihuahua are much more dilapidated than the similar
Casa Grande of the Gila; but, although both are
built of mud, a slight difference in the quality of the
mud employed, with the more abundant rains of Chihuahua,
would account for the better condition of the
Gila remains, and prevent us from assigning necessarily
a greater antiquity to those of Chihuahua. It is
known as a historical fact that the southern buildings
were not only in ruins at the coming of the Spaniards
in the middle of the sixteenth century, but had
been so long in that condition that the native knowledge
respecting them had passed into the state of a
tradition and a superstition. Certainly not less than
a century would suffice for this. Of the northern
ruins very many are known to have been inhabited
and flourishing towns when the Spaniards came.
That any were at that time in ruins is not proven,
though possible.</p>

<p>2. The material relics of the New Mexican group
bear no resemblance whatever to either Nahua or
Maya relics in the south. It has been constantly
stated and repeated by most writers, that all American
aboriginal monuments, the works of the Mound-Builders
of the Mississippi, the ruins of New Mexico
and Arizona, the Casas Grandes of Chihuahua, the
Edificios of Zacatecas, the pyramids of Anáhuac and
the central plateaux, Mitla, Palenque, the cities of
Yucatan, and finally Copan, all belong evidently to
one class and present one type; that all are such as
might reasonably be attributed to the same people in
different periods of their civilization. It is even
customary for travelers and writers to speak without
hesitation of Aztec ruins and relics in Arizona, as if
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_683">683</a></span>
there were no longer any doubt on the subject. So
far as the New Mexican link in the chain is concerned,
I most emphatically deny the resemblance,
on grounds which the reader of the preceding pages
already fully understands. I can hardly conceive of
structures reared by human hands differing more
essentially than the two classes in question. In the
common use of adobes for building-material; in the
plain walls rising to a height of several stories; in
the terrace structure, absence of doors in the lower
story, and the entrance by ladders; in the absence of
arched ceilings of overlapping blocks, of all pyramidal
structures, of sculptured blocks, of all architectural
decorations, of idols, temples, and every trace of
buildings evidently designed for religious rites, of
burial mounds and human remains; and in the character
of the rock-inscriptions and miscellaneous relics,
not to go farther into details, the New Mexican monuments
present no analogies to any of the southern
remains. I do not mean to express a decided opinion
that the Aztecs were not, some hundreds or thousands
of centuries ago, or even at a somewhat less
remote period, identical with the natives of New
Mexico, for I have great faith in the power of time
and environment to work unlimited changes in any
people; I simply claim that it is a manifest absurdity
to suppose that the monuments described were the
work of the Aztecs during a migration southward,
since the eleventh century, or of any people nearly
allied in blood and institutions to the Aztecs as they
were found in Anáhuac.</p>

<p>3. Not only do the ruins of this group bear no
resemblance to those of the south, but they represent
in all respects buildings like those still inhabited by
the Pueblo tribes and the Moquis, and do not differ
more among themselves than do the dwellings of the
peoples mentioned. Every one of them may be most
reasonably regarded as the work of the direct ancestors
of the present inhabitants of the Pueblo
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684">684</a></span>
towns, who did not differ to any great extent in
civilization or institutions from their descendants,
though they may very likely have been vastly superior
to them in power and wealth. Consequently
there is not a single relic in the whole region that
requires the agency of any extinct race of people, or
any other nations&mdash;using the word in a somewhat
wider signification than has sometimes been given to
it in the preceding volumes&mdash;than those now living
in the country. Not only do the remains not point
in themselves to any extinct race, but if there were
any traditional or other evidence indicating the past
agency of such a race, it would be impossible to reconcile
the traditional with the monumental evidence
except by the supposition that the Pueblos are a
foreign people who took possession of the abandoned
dwellings of another race, whose institutions they
imitated to the best of their ability; but I do not
know that such a theory has ever been advanced. I
am aware that this conclusion is sadly at variance
with the newspaper reports in constant circulation, of
marvelous cities, the remnants of an advanced but
extinct civilization, discovered by some trapper,
miner, or exploring expedition. I am also aware of
the probability that many ruins in addition to those
I have been able to describe, have been found by
military officials, government explorers, and private
individuals during the past ten years; and I hope
that the appearance of this volume may cause the
publication of much additional information on the
subject,&mdash;but that any of the newly discovered monuments
differ in type from those previously known,
there is much reason to doubt. Very many of the
newspaper accounts referred to relate to discoveries
made by Lieut. Wheeler's exploring party during the
past two or three years. Lieut. Wheeler informs me
that the reports, so far as they refer to the remains
of an extinct people, are without foundation, and that
his observations have led him to a conclusion practically
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685">685</a></span>
the same as my own respecting the builders of
the ruined Pueblo towns.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE ANCIENT PUEBLO TOWNS.</p>

<p>4. It follows that New Mexico, Arizona, and
northern Chihuahua were once inhabited by agricultural
semi-civilized tribes, not differing more among
themselves than do the Pueblo tribes of the present
time; the most fertile valleys of the region were
cultivated by them, and were dotted by fine town-dwellings
of stone and adobe, occupied in common
by many families, similar but superior to the present
Pueblo towns. At least a century, probably
much longer, before the Spaniards made their appearance,
the decline of this numerous and powerful people
began, and it has continued uninterruptedly down
to the present time, until only a mere remnant in the
Rio Grande and Moqui towns is left. Before the
Spaniards came all the southern towns, on the Gila
and its tributaries, had been abandoned; since that
time the decline of the northern nations, which the
Spaniards found in a tolerably flourishing condition,
is a matter of history. The reason of the decline
this is hardly the place to consider, but it is doubtless
to the inroads of outside warlike and predatory tribes
like the Apaches that we must look for the chief
cause. It is not impossible that natural changes in
the surface of the region, such as the drying-up of
springs, streams, or lakes, may have also contributed
to the same effect. These changes, however, if such
took place, were probably gradual in their operation;
for the location of the ruins in what are still in most
cases among the most fertile valleys, either in the
vicinity of water, or at least of a dried-up stream,
and their absence in every instance in the absolutely
desert tracts, show pretty conclusively that the towns
were not destroyed suddenly by any natural convulsion
which radically changed the face of the country.
It is not difficult to imagine how the agricultural
Pueblo communities, weakened perhaps at first by
some international strife which forced them to neglect
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_686">686</a></span>
the tillage of their land, and hard pressed by more
than usually persistent inroads from bands of Apaches
who plundered their crops and destroyed their irrigation-works,
visited perchance by pestilence, or by
earthquakes sent by some irate deity to dry up their
springs, were forced year by year to yield their fair
fields to the drifting sands, to abandon their southern
homes and unite their forces with kindred northern
tribes; till at last came the crowning blow of a foreign
invasion, which has well nigh extinguished an aboriginal
culture more interesting and admirable, if not in
all respects more advanced, than any other in North
America.

</p>

<p>Ruins of the New Mexican Pueblo type, described
in the preceding chapter, extend across the boundary
lines of New Mexico and Arizona, and have been
found by travelers in southern Utah and Colorado;
stone and bone implements similar to those used by
the natives when the first Europeans came and since
that time, are frequently picked up on the surface or
taken from aboriginal graves in most parts of the
whole northern region; a few scattered rock-inscriptions
are reported in several of the states; burial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_688">688</a></span>
mounds and other small earth-heaps of unknown use
are seen in many localities; shell mounds, some of
them of great size, occur at various points in the
coast region, as about San Francisco Bay and on
Vancouver Island, and they probably might be found
along nearly the whole coast line; and the mining
shafts of California have brought to light human remains,
implements wrought by human hands, and
bones of extinct animals, at great depths below the surface,
evidently of great age. With the preceding
paragraph and a short account of the ruins of Colorado,
I might consistently dispose of the antiquities
of the Northwest.</p>

<p>There has not been found and reported on good authority
a single monument or relic which is sufficient
to prove that the country was ever inhabited by any
people whose claims to be regarded as civilized were
superior to those of the tribes found by Europeans
within its limits. It is true that some implements
may not exactly agree with those of the tribes now
occupying the same particular locality, and some
graves indicate slight differences in the manner of
burial, but this could hardly be otherwise in a country
inhabited by so many nations whose boundaries were
constantly changing. Yet I have often heard the
Aztec relics of California and Oregon very confidently
spoken of. It is a remarkable fact that to most men
who find a piece of stone bearing marks of having
been formed by human hands, the very first idea suggested
is that it represents an extinct race, while the
last conclusion arrived at is that the relic may be the
work of a tribe still living in the vicinity where it was
found.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CALIFORNIAN RELICS.</p>

<p class="p2">California has within her limits large quantities of
native utensils and many burial deposits, some of
which doubtless date back to the time when no European
had yet set foot in the country. A complete
description of such relics, illustrated with cuts of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_689">689</a></span>
typical specimens from different sections of the state,
would be of great value in connection with the account
of the Californian tribes given in a preceding
volume; but unfortunately the material for such description
and cuts are utterly wanting, and will not
be supplied for many years. Officers and assistants
connected with the U. S. Coast Survey and other
government exploring expeditions, are constantly,
though slowly, gathering relics for the national collection,
and a few individuals acting in an unofficial
capacity have examined certain localities and described
the aboriginal implements found therein
through trustworthy mediums. But most of the
discoveries in this direction are recorded only in newspaper
accounts, which, in a large majority of cases,
offer no guarantee of their authenticity or accuracy.
Many are self-evident hoaxes; many others are doubtless
as reliable as if published in the narrative of the
most trust-worthy explorer or in the transactions of
any learned society; but to decide upon the relative
merits of the great bulk of these accounts is altogether
impossible, to say nothing of the absence of
drawings, which, after all, are the only satisfactory
description of miscellaneous relics. I therefore deem
it not advisable to fill the pages of a long chapter
with a compilation of the almost innumerable newspaper
items in my possession, useless for the most
part to antiquarians, and comparatively without interest
to the general reader. Dr Alex. S. Taylor has
already made quite a complete compilation of the
earlier accounts in Californian newspapers, which he
published in the <i>California Farmer</i> in 1860-3. Without,
as a rule, going into details, I shall present a
brief résumé of what has been written about Californian
relics of aboriginal times, giving in full only a
few reports of undoubted authenticity.<a id="FNanchor_XII-1" href="#Footnote_XII-1" class="fnanchor">[XII-1]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_690">690</a></span></p>

<p>Brasseur de Bourbourg tells us that in the distant
north "was found anciently a city named Tula, the
ruins of which are thought to have been found in
the valley, still so little explored, of Tulares. The
Americans have announced in their newspapers the
discovery of these Californian ruins, but can one
credit the reports?" Brasseur possibly alludes in the
paragraph quoted to certain reports circulated about
1853, which announced the discovery, somewhere in
the desert of the Colorado on the California side, of
a ruined bridge of stone, where no river had run for
ages, together with an immense pyramid, and other
grand remains. These reports seem to have originated
in the correspondence of a Placerville newspaper;
but whether they were manufactured in the
office of the paper, or were actually sent in by some
roaming prospector of an inventive turn of mind,
does not appear.<a id="FNanchor_XII-2" href="#Footnote_XII-2" class="fnanchor">[XII-2]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COLORADO DESERT.</p>

<p>Mr Blake found in the Colorado desert "several
long, path-like discolorations of the surface, extending
for miles in nearly straight lines, which were Indian
trails. The only change which was produced appeared
to be the removal or dimming of the polish on the
pebbles. There was no break in the hard surface,
and no dust. That the distinctness of the trail was
made by the removing of the polish only, became
evident from the fact that figures and Indian hieroglyphics
were traced, or imprinted, on the surface
adjoining the path, apparently by pounding or bruising
the surface layer of the pebbles. These trails
seemed very old, and may have endured for many
generations."<a id="FNanchor_XII-3" href="#Footnote_XII-3" class="fnanchor">[XII-3]</a> A writer in the <i>Bulletin</i> mentions a
road which extends from the mouth of the Coahuila
Valley of San Gorgonio Pass, beginning at Noble's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_691">691</a></span>
ranch, eastwardly across the desert in almost a
straight line, to the mouth of the Colorado Cañon.
The earth is worn deep, and along its course the
surface is strewn with broken pottery. In many of
the soft rocks the imprints of the feet of men and
animals are still plainly visible. The road is not
much over a foot wide, and from it branch off side
paths leading to springs or other sources of water.<a id="FNanchor_XII-4" href="#Footnote_XII-4" class="fnanchor">[XII-4]</a>
The only other remains in the desert of which I find
any record are some rock-inscriptions at Pah Ute
Creek, located about thirty miles west from the
Mojave villages. Mr Whipple gives a drawing of
the inscriptions, which bear a strong resemblance in
their general character, as might be expected, to
those which have been found in so many localities
in the New Mexican region.<a id="FNanchor_XII-5" href="#Footnote_XII-5" class="fnanchor">[XII-5]</a></p>

<p>The vertical face of a granite cliff at San Francisquito
Pass, near a spring, was covered with carved
characters, probably similar to those last described.
One of the characters resembled a long chain, with a
ball at one end, surrounded by rays like those employed
in our representations of the sun; another
was like in form to an anchor. Well-worn ancient
foot-paths, old reservoirs, and other undescribed relics
are reported in the vicinity of Owen's lake and river.<a id="FNanchor_XII-6" href="#Footnote_XII-6" class="fnanchor">[XII-6]</a>
Painted figures in blue, red, and white, are reported,
together with some Spanish inscriptions of a date
preceding 1820, in Painted Rock Valley, four days'
journey east by south from Tejon Pass, also in the
cañada of the San Juan arroyo, which empties into
the Salinas River near the mission of San Miguel.
In the former case the figures are painted on a blue
grayish rock, about twenty feet square and hollowed
out in bowl shape.<a id="FNanchor_XII-7" href="#Footnote_XII-7" class="fnanchor">[XII-7]</a>

<p>Mr Paul Schumacher, engaged in the service of
the United States Coast Survey, has taken great
interest in Californian aboriginal relics, which he has
collected for the Smithsonian Institution at Washington.
In the vicinity of San Luis Obispo, between
points Sal and San Luis, he examined during
the past year four graves or burial deposits, known
as <i>nipomo</i>, <i>walckhe</i>, <i>kesmali</i>, <i>temeteti</i>. These graves
furnished some three hundred human skeletons, or
rather about that number were examined, and also
quite a large number of domestic utensils, weapons,
and ornaments. Among these relics great uniformity
is observed, indicating that all the graves belonged to
the same tribe of natives. Nine specimens are shown
in the cut on the opposite page, made from Mr
Schumacher's drawings. Fig. 1, 2, and 9, represent
large cooking-pots, globular or pear-shaped, and hollowed
out of magnesian mica. The circular opening
of fig. 9, having a small and narrow rim, measures
only five inches in diameter, while the greatest diameter
of the pot is eighteen inches. Near the edge
of the opening this vessel is only a quarter of an
inch thick, but the thickness increases regularly
towards the bottom, where it is an inch and a quarter.
Sandstone mortars of different dimensions, but
of similar forms, were found in great abundance with
the other utensils, one of the largest of which is
shown in fig. 8. This is sixteen inches in diameter
and thirteen in height. The smallest are only an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_693"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_694">694</a></span>
inch and a half high, and three inches in diameter.
The pestles are of the same material, and their form
is shown in fig. 3. There was moreover, quite an
assortment of what seem to be cups, measuring from
one and a quarter to six inches in diameter, and
neatly worked out of serpentine, the surface of which
was brightly polished. Specimens are shown in fig.
5 and 7. Another similar one, the smallest found,
was enclosed in three shells, in a very curious manner,
as shown in fig. 6. In this enclosed cup was a
quantity of what is described as paint; and traces of
the same material were found in all the cups, indicating
that they were not used to contain food. Fig.
4 represents a plate which is presumably of stone,
although the cut would seem to indicate a shell.
These domestic implements deposited by the aborigines
with their dead were rarely broken, and when
they were so, the breakage was caused in every
instance by the pressure of the soil or other superimposed
objects. One peculiar circumstance in connection
with these relics was that some broken
mortars and pestles were repaired by the use of
asphaltum as a cement. All the relics collected by
Mr Schumacher, as well as those which I have
copied, are preserved in the National Museum at
Washington.<a id="FNanchor_XII-8" href="#Footnote_XII-8" class="fnanchor">[XII-8]</a> The same explorer is now engaged
in making an examination of the islands of the Santa
Barbara Channel, where it is not improbable that
many interesting relics may be discovered. Mr Taylor
heard from a resident of San Buenaventura that
"in a recent stay on Santa Rosa Island, in 1861, he
often met with the entire skeletons of Indians in the
caves. The signs of their rancherías were very frequent,
and the remains of metates, mortars, earthen
pots, and other utensils very common. The metates
were of a dark stone, and made somewhat after the
pattern of the Mexican. Extensive caves were often
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_695">695</a></span>
met with which seemed to serve as burial places of
the Indians, as entire skeletons and numerous skulls
were plentifully scattered about in their recesses."
Some very wonderful skulls are also reported as
having been found on the islands, furnished with
double teeth all the way round the jaw.<a id="FNanchor_XII-9" href="#Footnote_XII-9" class="fnanchor">[XII-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS REMAINS.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous relics reported on authority varying
from indifferent to bad at different points in the
southern part of the state, are as follows: In 1819
an old lady saw a gigantic skeleton dug up by soldiers
at Purísima on the Lompock rancho. The natives
deemed it a god, and it was re-buried by
direction of the padre. Taheechaypah pass and the
mission of San Buenaventura are other localities
where skeletons of extraordinary size have been found.
The old natives at San Luis Rey have seen in the
mountain passes tracks of men and animals in solid
rock. These tracks were made, those of the men at
least, by their fathers fleeing from some convulsion
of nature which occurred not many generations back.
Nine miles north of Santa Barbara on the Dos Pueblos
rancho, some small mounds only two or three
feet high have been seen on the point of the mesa
overlooking the sea. Mr Carvalho claims to have
dug from a small mound near Los Angeles the bones
of a mastodon, including four perfect teeth, one of
which weighed six pounds. Miss Saxon speaks of
high mounds in the vicinity of rivers, said to have
been once the site of villages so located for protection
against floods.<a id="FNanchor_XII-10" href="#Footnote_XII-10" class="fnanchor">[XII-10]</a></p>

<p>In the plain at the mouth of the Saticoy River,
twelve miles below San Buenaventura, and five or six
miles from the sea, are reported two mounds, regular,
rounded, and bare of trees. One of them is over a
mile long and two hundred feet high, and the other
about half as large. If the report of their existence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696">696</a></span>
is correct, there seems to be no evidence that they
are of artificial formation, except their isolated position
on the plain, and a native tradition that they are
burial-places. One writer suggests that they are the
graves of a people, or of their kings, whose cities are
buried beneath the waters of the Santa Barbara
Channel. The site of the cities presents some obstacles
to exploration, and the details of their construction
are not fully known. Twenty miles farther up the
Saticoy is a group of small mounds, ten or twelve in
number and five or six feet high. They "seem to
have been water-worn or worked out by running
water all around the mounds so as to isolate each one."
Near these mounds, on the Cayetano rancho, is a field
of some five hundred acres, divided by parallel ridges
of earth, and having distinct traces of irrigating
ditches, supplied by a canal which extends two or
three miles up the Sespe arroyo. It is said that the
present inhabitants of this region, both native and
Spanish, have no knowledge of the origin of these
agricultural works.<a id="FNanchor_XII-11" href="#Footnote_XII-11" class="fnanchor">[XII-11]</a></p>

<p>It is said that the New Almaden quicksilver mines
were worked by the natives for the purpose of obtaining
vermilion, long before the coming of the Spaniards.
The excavation made by the aboriginal miners
was long supposed to be a natural cavern, extending
about one hundred feet horizontally into the hill, until
some skeletons, rude mining tools, and other relics
of human presence revealed the secret.<a id="FNanchor_XII-12" href="#Footnote_XII-12" class="fnanchor">[XII-12]</a></p>

<p>In various localities about Monterey, in addition to
the usual mortars and arrow-heads, holes in the living
rock, used probably as mortars for pounding acorns
and seeds, are reported by Taylor; and the Santa
Cruz 'skull cave' is spoken of as 'noted throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_697">697</a></span>
the country' for having furnished bones now preserved
in the Smithsonian Institution.<a id="FNanchor_XII-13" href="#Footnote_XII-13" class="fnanchor">[XII-13]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS FROM THE MINES.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most interesting classes of Californian
antiquities is that which includes aboriginal remains
discovered in the mining counties, at considerable
depths below the surface of the ground. The stone
implements thus found are not in themselves particularly
interesting, or different from those which
have been found under other circumstances; nor do
they include any specimens which indicate the former
existence of any race more advanced than that
found in the country by Europeans. But the chief
importance of these antiquities consists in the great
depth at which some of them have been found, and in
the fact that they have been found in connection with
the fossil bones of animals belonging to species now
no longer existing in the country. The existence of
the work of human hands buried hundreds of feet beneath
the many successive layers of different rocks
and earths, might not necessarily imply a greater age
than one dating a few centuries before the coming of
the Spaniards; although few would be willing to admit,
probably, that natural convulsions so extensive
have taken place at so recent an epoch. But when
the work of human hands is shown to have been discovered
in connection with the bones of mastodons,
elephants, horses, camels, and other animals long since
extinct, and that they have been so found there seems
to be sufficient proof, it is hardly possible with consistency
to deny that these implements date from a
remote antiquity. Newspaper items describing relics
of this class are almost numberless; a few of the
specimens have fallen into the hands of scientific men,
who have carefully examined and described them; but
a great majority, even of such implements as have not
been completely overlooked by the miner who dug or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_698">698</a></span>
washed them from their deep resting-places, have been
lost after exciting a momentary curiosity, and their
important testimony lost to science. Mr C. D. Voy
of Oakland has shown much energy and interest in
the examination of stone implements and fossils
from the mines. The relics themselves have of course
been found in almost every instance by miners in
their search for gold; but Mr Voy has personally visited
most of the localities where such discoveries
were reported, and seems to have taken all possible
pains to verify the authenticity of the discoveries,
having in many cases obtained sworn statements from
the parties who made them. An unpublished manuscript
written by this gentleman is entitled <i>Relics of
the Stone Age in California</i>, and is illustrated with
many photographs of specimens from his own and
other collections. This work, kindly furnished me by
Mr Voy, is probably the most complete extant on the
subject, and from it I take the following descriptions.
The author proceeds by counties, first describing the
geology of each county, and then the relics of whose
existence he has been able to learn, and the localities
where they were found. Except a brief statement in
a few cases of the depth at which stone remains
were found, and of the strata that covered them, I
shall not touch upon the geologic formation of the
mining region. Nor does a particular or scientific description
of the fossil remains come within the scope
of my work. A brief account of the stone implements
and the positions in which they have been discovered
will suffice.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TUOLUMNE COUNTY.</p>

<p>Of all the counties Tuolumne has apparently
proved the richest in antiquarian remains. From the
mining tunnels which penetrate Table Mountain
there was taken in 1858 a stone mortar holding two
quarts, at a depth of three hundred feet from the surface,
lying in auriferous gravel under a thick strata
of lava. In 1862 another mortar was found at a
depth of three hundred and forty feet, one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_699">699</a></span>
and four of which were composed of lava, and eighteen
hundred feet from the mouth of the tunnel. This
relic is in Mr Voy's collection, accompanied by a
sworn statement of the circumstances of its finding.
Dr Snell is said to have had in his possession in 1862
a pendant or shuttle of silicious slate, similar to others
of which I shall give a cut; spear-heads six or
eight inches long, and broken off at the hole where
they were attached to the shaft; and a scoop, or
ladle, of steatite. These relics were found under Table
Mountain at the same depth as the preceding,
together with fossil bones of the mastodon and other
animals, and are preserved in the Smithsonian Institute
and in the museum of Yale College. The cut
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_700">700</a></span>
represents a stone mortar and pestle, found at Kincaid
Flat in clayey auriferous gravel, sixteen or
twenty feet below the surface, where many other
stone implements, with bones of the mastodon, elephant,
horse, and camel, have been found at different
times. A bow handle, or shuttle, of micaceous slate
found here will be shown in another cut with similar
relics from a different locality.<a id="FNanchor_XII-14" href="#Footnote_XII-14" class="fnanchor">[XII-14]</a></p>

<p>At Shaw's Flat, with bones of the mastodon, a
stone bead of calc-spar, two inches long and the same
in circumference, was taken from under a strata of
lava at a point three hundred feet from the mouth of
the tunnel. The granite mortar shown in the cut,
holding about a pint, came from the same mining
town.</p>

bones of the mastodon were found together in 1855.<a id="FNanchor_XII-15" href="#Footnote_XII-15" class="fnanchor">[XII-15]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_701">701</a></span>
Wood's Creek was another locality where stone relics
with fossil bones, including those of the tapir, are
reported to have been dug out at a depth of twenty
to forty feet. The mortar and pestle shown in the
cut is one of many stone implements found, with
fossil bones, at Gold Springs Gulch, in 1863, at a
depth of sixteen feet in auriferous gravel, like the
most of such relics. It is twelve and a half inches
in diameter, weighs thirty pounds, and holds about
two quarts. The cross-lines pecked in on the sides
with some sharp instrument, are of rare occurrence if
not unique. Among the other implements found
here, are what Mr Voy describes as "discoidal stones,
or perhaps spinal whorls. They are from three to
four inches in diameter, and about an inch and a half
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_702">702</a></span>
thick, both sides being concave, with centre perforated.
It has been suggested that these stones were
used in certain hurling games." They are of granite
and hard sandstone. The author has heard of similar
relics in Ohio, Denmark, and Chili. Another relic,
found at the same place in 1862, with the usual bones
under twenty to thirty feet of calcareous tufa, is a
flat oval dish of granite, eighteen inches and a half
in diameter, two or three inches thick, and weighing
forty pounds. It is shown in the cut, and, like the
preceding, is preserved in Mr Voy's cabinet, now at
the University of California. Texas Flat was another
locality where fossil bones were found with fresh-water
shells.<a id="FNanchor_XII-16" href="#Footnote_XII-16" class="fnanchor">[XII-16]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_703">703</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CALAVERAS COUNTY.</p>

<p>Calaveras County has also yielded many interesting
relics of a past age, of the same nature as those
described in Tuolumne.<a id="FNanchor_XII-17" href="#Footnote_XII-17" class="fnanchor">[XII-17]</a> The famous 'Calaveras
skull' was taken from a mining shaft at Altaville, at
a depth of one hundred and thirty feet beneath seven
strata of lava and gravel.<a id="FNanchor_XII-18" href="#Footnote_XII-18" class="fnanchor">[XII-18]</a> The evidence was sufficient
to convince Prof. Whitney and other scientific
men that this skull was actually found as claimed, although
on the other hand some doubt and not a little
ridicule have been expressed about the subject. Many
stone mortars and mastodon-bones have been found
about Altaville and Murphy's, but not under lava.<a id="FNanchor_XII-19" href="#Footnote_XII-19" class="fnanchor">[XII-19]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_704">704</a></span></p>

<p>At San Andrés, in 1864, according to sworn statements
in Mr Voy's possession, large stone mortars
were taken from a layer of cemented gravel six feet
thick, lying under the following strata:&mdash;coarse sedimentary
volcanic material, five feet; sand and gravel,
one hundred feet; brownish volcanic ash, three feet;
cemented sand, four feet; blueish volcanic sand, fifteen
feet. At the Chili Gulch, near Mokelumne
Hill, the skull of a rhinoceros is reported to have
been found in 1863.<a id="FNanchor_XII-20" href="#Footnote_XII-20" class="fnanchor">[XII-20]</a></p>

<p>The mortar shown in the cut was found in gravel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_705">705</a></span>
at a depth of ten feet, at Shingle Springs in El Dorado
County. At Georgetown and vicinity there
were found at different dates, large stone dishes very
similar to that at Gold Springs Gulch, shown in a preceding
cut; grooved stones like those at Spanish Flat,
soon to be mentioned; and mortars resembling that at
Kincaid Flat. At Spanish Flat were found several
oval stones with grooves round their circumference, as
shown in the preceding cut, and weighing from a
pound and a half to two pounds. They were apparently
used as hammers or weapons by fitting a withe
handle round them at the groove. Many other mortars
and stone implements were taken from the
same locality, including two pendants, shuttles, or
bow-handles, very well worked from greenstone, five
or six inches long, and about one inch thick in the
middle. These two relics, together with a similar
one from Table Mountain before alluded to, are
shown in the cut. At Diamond Spring mortars were
found at a depth of a hundred feet, and both fossil
bones and stone relics have been taken from time
to time from the mines about Placerville.<a id="FNanchor_XII-21" href="#Footnote_XII-21" class="fnanchor">[XII-21]</a>

have been found, according to Mr Voy's explorations,

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS MINE RELICS.</p>

<p>The cut shows a stone relic discovered in digging a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_708">708</a></span>
well in the San Joaquin Valley, imbedded in the
gravel thirty feet below the surface. "The material
is sienite and the instrument is ground and polished
so as to display in marked contrast the pure white of
the feldspar and the dark-green or black of the hornblende.
It is in the form of a double-cone, one end
terminating in a point, while the other end is
blunted, where it is pierced with a hole which instead
of being a uniform gauge, is rimmed out, the
rimming having been started from the opposite sides.
In examining this beautiful relic, one is led almost
instinctively to believe that it was used as a plummet
for the purpose of determining the perpendicular
to the horizon. So highly-wrought a stone would
hardly have been used as a sinker for a fishing-net:
it may have been suspended from the neck as a
personal ornament. When we consider its symmetry
of form, the contrast of colors brought out by the
process of grinding and polishing, and the delicate
drilling of the hole through a material so liable to
fracture, we are free to say it affords an exhibition of
the lapidary's skill superior to anything yet furnished
by the Stone Age of either continent," at least such
is Mr Foster's conclusion. Prof. Whitney states
that he has two or three similar implements, and
that they are generally regarded as sinkers for use in
fishing.<a id="FNanchor_XII-25" href="#Footnote_XII-25" class="fnanchor">[XII-25]</a> Mr Taylor tells us that he saw in 1852, on
a high mesa, probably a league in circumference, on
or near the Merced River, thousands of small
mounds, five or six feet high, and apparently of
earth only.<a id="FNanchor_XII-26" href="#Footnote_XII-26" class="fnanchor">[XII-26]</a> Capron says that on the plains of San
Joaquin "are found immense mounds of earth, which
present evidences of their great antiquity. It is
supposed that they were thrown up, by the Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_709">709</a></span>
for observatories, from which to survey the floods,
or as places of resort for safety when the plains became
suddenly inundated, and the ranging hunters
were caught far in the interior."<a id="FNanchor_XII-27" href="#Footnote_XII-27" class="fnanchor">[XII-27]</a> In the banks of a
creek near Martinez, resting on yellow clay, under
five feet of surface soil, a mortar and pestle were
recently found by some boys, according to a local
newspaper. The mortar was about sixty inches in
circumference, and weighed nearly two hundred
pounds. "It has the form of a slightly flattened
well-rounded duck egg; and has evidently been artificially
shaped in exterior form, as well as in the
bowl, and looks as fresh as if it had but yesterday
been turned off from the Indian sculptor's hands,
while the polish of the pestle is smooth and lustrous,
as if it had been in daily use for the hundred or two
years, at least, that it must have been lying under
the inverted mortar, as shown by the level of five-feet
accumulations of the valley-surface stratum of
soil above the yellow clay upon which it was found,
together with the partially-decomposed remains of a
human frame."<a id="FNanchor_XII-28" href="#Footnote_XII-28" class="fnanchor">[XII-28]</a></p>

<p class="caption p2">Relics from a Shell-Mound&mdash;San Francisco.</p>
</div>

<p>Only one class of Californian antiquities remains
to be mentioned&mdash;the shell mounds. They are probably
very numerous, and a thorough examination of
their contents could hardly fail to be here as it has
proved in Europe, a source of very important results
in connection with ethnological studies. Little or
nothing has been done in the way of such an examination,
although a few mounds have been opened in
excavating for roads or foundations of buildings.
These few have yielded numerous stone, bone, and
shell implements and ornaments, together with human
remains, as is reported, but the relics have been
for the most part lost or scattered, and submitted to
no scientific examination and comparison. Dr Yates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_710">710</a></span>
sent to the Smithsonian Institute, in 1869, a collection
of relics taken from mounds in Alameda County.
It is not expressly stated that these were shell
mounds, although I have heard of the existence of
several in that county. This collection included,
"stone pestles, perforators or awls, sinkers, a phallus,
spindles, a soapstone ladle, stone mortar and pestle,
pipe bowls, shell and perforated stone ornaments, an
ancient awl and serrated implements of bone."<a id="FNanchor_XII-29" href="#Footnote_XII-29" class="fnanchor">[XII-29]</a> A
very large shell mound is reported near San Pablo,
in Contra Costa County. It is said to be almost a
mile long and a half a mile wide, and its surface is
covered with shrubbery. The shells composing this
mound are those of the oyster, clam, and mussel, all
having been exposed to the action of fire, and nearly
all broken. Fragments of pottery made of red clay
are found on the surface and near the top.<a id="FNanchor_XII-30" href="#Footnote_XII-30" class="fnanchor">[XII-30]</a> Many
smaller shell mounds are reported in the vicinity of
San Mateo, and one has been opened in making a
road at Saucelito during the present year, furnishing
many stone relics, of which I have no particular description.
Quite a number of mounds are known to
exist on the peninsula of San Francisco, several
being in the vicinity of the silk factory on the San
Bruno road. One of them covered an area of two
acres, was at least twenty-five feet deep, and from
it were taken arrow-heads, hammers, and many
other relics. One of these shell mounds, near the
old Bay View race track is being opened by Chinamen
engaged in preparation for some building, as I
write this chapter. Mr James Deans, of whose explorations
I shall have more to say when treating of
the antiquities of British Columbia, has brought me
a large number of stone and bone relics taken from
this deposit, the different classes of which are illustrated
in the accompanying cut. Fig. 1 is an awl of
deer-bone, and fig. 2 is another implement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_711"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_712">712</a></span>
same material, curiously grooved at the end. These
bone implements occur by thousands, being from
three to eight inches in length. Fig. 3, 4, are perhaps
stone sinkers, or as is thought by some, weights
used in weaving, symmetrically formed, the former
from diorite, the latter from sandstone, and not
polished. Fig. 3 is four inches long, and an inch and
a half in its greatest diameter. Hundreds of these
pear-shaped weights are found in the mounds, but
the end is usually broken off, as is the case with
fig. 4. Fig. 5 is an implement carved from a black
clayey slate, and has a brightly polished surface. It
is four inches long, one inch in diameter at the larger
end, and three quarters of an inch at the smaller.
It is hollow, but the bore diminishes in size regularly
from each end, until at a point about an inch and a
half from the smaller end it is only a quarter of an
inch in diameter. I have no idea what purpose this
implement was used for, unless it served as a handle
for a small knife or awl, or possibly as a pipe.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is the rather fragmentary and unsatisfactory
information I am able to present respecting aboriginal
relics in California. Doubtless there are many relics,
and valuable scraps of information respecting the
circumstances of their discovery, in the possession of
individuals, of which no mention is made in this chapter&mdash;indeed,
I expect to hear of a hundred such cases
within a month after the appearance of this volume;
but many years must necessarily elapse before a satisfactory
and comprehensive account of the antiquities
of our state can be written, and in the meantime there
is a promising field for patient investigation. The
difference, after all, between this chapter and many of
those that precede it, in respect to thoroughness, is
more apparent than real; that is, it results naturally
from the nature of north-western remains. For if
there were architectural monuments, pyramids, temples,
and fortifications, or grand sculptured idols and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_713">713</a></span>
decorations, in California and her sister states, there
is no doubt that such monuments would have been
ere this more thoroughly explored than those of Palenque;
and on the other hand, respecting the only
classes of antiquities found in the Northwest, there
yet remains as much or more to learn in Mexico and
Central America as in the Pacific United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ANTIQUITIES OF NEVADA.</p>

<p class="p2">Respecting the antiquities of Nevada, I have only
the following account of a ruined city in the south-eastern
part of the state, discovered by what is
spoken of as the 'Morgan Exploring Expedition,' and
described by a correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i>.
"On October fifteenth, in the centre of a large valley
we discovered some Indian salt works, but there were
no signs of their having been lately used. In the
southern section of the same valley, was a curious
collection of rocks, mounds and pillars, covering several
acres in extent and resembling the ruins of an
ancient city. We saw some remnants of what had
once been arches, with keystones still perfect, and a
number of small stone pillars constructed with a peculiar
kind of red mortar or cement, set upright about
twenty feet apart, as if they had been used to support
an aqueduct for conveying water from a large
stream half a mile distant, into the outskirts of the
city. In some places the lines of streets were made
distinctly visible by the great regularity of the stones.
These streets were now covered with sand many feet
deep, and seemed to run at right angles to each other.
Some of the stones had evidently been cut into
squares with hard tools, although their forms had
been nearly destroyed by centuries of time. The impression
forced upon our minds was that the place
had been once inhabited by human beings somewhat
advanced in civilization. Many traders noticed the
existence of similar ruins in other sections of the
country between the Rocky and Sierra Nevada
Mountains. They may probably be the sites of once
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_714">714</a></span>
flourishing fields and habitations of the ancient Aztecs."<a id="FNanchor_XII-31" href="#Footnote_XII-31" class="fnanchor">[XII-31]</a>
It is just possible that the New Mexican
type of ruins extends across into Nevada as it is
known to into Utah and Colorado, and that a group
of such remains was the foundation of the report
quoted. It is quite as likely, however, that the report
is groundless.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">SALT LAKE VALLEY.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr Rae examined a group of burial mounds in the
Salt Lake Valley, Utah, and took from them "flint
spear heads, flint arrow-heads, stone implements and
fragments of rude pottery." These mounds had the
appearance of natural sand-hills, as the people in the
vicinity supposed them to be.<a id="FNanchor_XII-32" href="#Footnote_XII-32" class="fnanchor">[XII-32]</a> An article in the
<i>Salt Lake Telegraph</i> is the only other authority that
I find on these mounds, and this does not specify their
locality. "The mounds, as they exist to-day, do not
exhibit much uniformity, but this can be accounted
for by the disintegrating action of rains and winds, to
which they have been so long subject. Immediately
north, south and west of the largest barrow, traces
can be seen of others now all but obliterated, and the
locality bears unmistakable evidences of once being
the site of very extensive earthworks. In one mound
or barrow only, the largest, were remains found, and
they were exposed on or very near the surface of the
sandy soil, in one or two large hollows near the centre.
The other barrows were destitute, at least on the surface,
but what there may be below it is hard to say.
Of all the relics, except those of charred bone, which
are comparatively plentiful, and some in a state of petrifaction,
that of pottery is the most abundant, and
to this day some of it retains a very perfect glaze.
Much of it, however, is rough, and from the specimens
we saw, the art does not appear to have attained
to so high a degree of perfection as among the ancient
nations that inhabited the Mississippi and Ohio valleys.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_715">715</a></span>
The largest piece of pottery seen was not
above three inches square, and it appeared, as did all
the other pieces, to have formed a portion of some
rounded vessel, probably a cinerary urn or something
of that kind. Other articles were seen, such as a
fragment of pearly shell, several other shells, a white
cylindrical bead, a small ring probably a bead also,
and a stone knife." There were also several nicely
shaped arrow-heads, of obsidian, agate, rock-crystal,
carnelian, and flint. Granite mills are mentioned in
addition to the other relics.<a id="FNanchor_XII-33" href="#Footnote_XII-33" class="fnanchor">[XII-33]</a> The same authority
speaks of an extensive fortification or entrenched
camp at the head of Coon's Cañon, about twenty
miles south-west of Salt Lake City. The works are
now from four to eight feet high, and the places of
entrance are distinctly marked.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ROCK-INSCRIPTIONS.</p>

<p>Remy and Brenchley note the finding of colored
pottery at Cedar City, indicating "that the Mormon
city is built on the site of a considerable city belonging
to the Aztecs," for there is no state anywhere in
the north where the Aztecs did not live at some time
or other. Whole specimens of pottery are not found,
but the fragments are said to show a high degree
of perfection; the same authors claim that furnaces
for the manufacture of pottery are still seen, and
further say: "At some miles to the north as well
as to the south of Cedar,&mdash;to the north near Little
Salt Lake, to the south near Harmony,&mdash;are to be
seen great rocks covered over with glyphic inscriptions,
some portions of which, sketched at random,
are accurately represented in our engraving. These
inscriptions or figures are coarsely executed; but
they all represent objects easy of recognition, and
for the most part copied from nature."<a id="FNanchor_XII-34" href="#Footnote_XII-34" class="fnanchor">[XII-34]</a> From
Carvalho I quote that "on Red Creek cañon, six
miles north of Parowan there are very massive, abrupt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_716">716</a></span>
granite rocks, which rise perpendicularly out of
the valley to the height of many hundred feet. On
the surface of many of them, apparently engraved
with some steel instrument, to the depth of an inch,
are numerous hieroglyphics, representing the human
hand and foot, horses, dogs, rabbits, birds and also a
sort of zodiac. These engravings present the same
time-worn appearance as the rest of the rocks; the
most elaborately engraved figures were thirty feet
from the ground. I had to clamber up the rocks to
make a drawing of them. These engravings evidently
display prolonged and continued labor, and I
judge them to have been executed by a different class
of persons than the Indians, who now inhabit these
valleys and mountains&mdash;ages seem to have passed
since they were done. When we take into consideration
the compact nature of the blue granite and the
depth of the engravings, years must have been spent
in their execution. For what purpose were they
made? and by whom, and at what period of time?
It seems physically impossible that those I have
mentioned as being thirty feet from the valley, could
have been worked in the present position of the
rocks. Some great convulsion of nature may have
thrown them up as they now are. Some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_717">717</a></span>
figures are as large as life, many of them about one-fourth
size." The same author reports the remains
of an adobe town a mile further down the cañon,
with implements&mdash;remains said to have been found
there by the first Mormons that came to the valley.<a id="FNanchor_XII-35" href="#Footnote_XII-35" class="fnanchor">[XII-35]</a>
Mr Foster quotes from a Denver paper an item
recording the discovery of a mound in southern
Utah, which yielded relics displaying great artistic
skill;<a id="FNanchor_XII-36" href="#Footnote_XII-36" class="fnanchor">[XII-36]</a> and finally I take from Mr Schoolcraft's work
cuts showing inscriptions on a cliff in a locality not
clearly specified.<a id="FNanchor_XII-37" href="#Footnote_XII-37" class="fnanchor">[XII-37]</a> Some remains in the south-eastern

<p class="p2">About half a mile west of Golden City, Jefferson

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_718">718</a></span>
Institution the existence of some ancient remains,
at the junction of two ravines. They consist
of a central mound of granitic sand not over twelve
inches high, with traces of five or six shallow pits
about it; all surrounded by traces of a wall consisting
of a circle of moss-covered rough stones partially imbedded
in the soil. South of the central mound is
also a saucer-shaped pit, measuring twelve feet in
width and from fifteen to eighteen inches in depth.
At this point buffalo-bones and fragments of antlers
are plentiful, and pieces of flint with plates of mica
have also been discovered.<a id="FNanchor_XII-38" href="#Footnote_XII-38" class="fnanchor">[XII-38]</a> Mr Farnham speaks of
a ruined city covering an area of one mile by three
fourths of a mile, with streets crossing at right
angles, buildings of rough trap rock in cement, a
mound in the centre, and much glazed pottery&mdash;all
this on the north bank of the Colorado, four hundred
miles up the river, and as likely to be in the territory
of Colorado as anywhere.<a id="FNanchor_XII-39" href="#Footnote_XII-39" class="fnanchor">[XII-39]</a> Mr Foster quotes
from a Denver newspaper a report of large granite
blocks, of the nature of 'dolmens' standing in an upright

<p class="p2">There remain to be described in this part of the
country only the remains of aboriginal structures
in the south-western corner of Colorado and the
south-eastern corner of Utah, remains which, although
made known to the world only through a
three or four days' exploration by a party of three
men, are of the greatest interest and importance.
They are found in the valleys or cañons of the rivers
Mancos and McElmo, northern tributaries of the
San Juan, on the southern tributaries of which river
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_719">719</a></span>
are the ruins, already described, of the Chaco and

<p class="sidenote">JACKSON'S EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>In September, 1874, Mr W. H. Jackson and Mr
Ingersoll, connected with the United States Geological
and Geographical Survey party, guided by Capt.
John Moss, an old resident perfectly familiar with
the country and its natives, descended both the cañons
referred to, for the express purpose of examining ancient
structures reported to exist there. Notwithstanding
the brief duration of their exploration, as
they understood their business and had a photographic
apparatus along, their accounts are extremely complete
and satisfactory. Mr Ingersoll published an
account of the trip in the <i>New York Tribune</i> of Nov.
3, 1874; and Mr Jackson in the Bulletin of the
Survey, printed by government.<a id="FNanchor_XII-42" href="#Footnote_XII-42" class="fnanchor">[XII-42]</a> The latter account
was accompanied by fourteen illustrations, and Prof.
J. V. Hayden, Geologist in charge of the Survey, has
had the kindness to furnish me also with the original
photographs made during the expedition.</p>

<p>The Rio Mancos rises in the Sierra La Plata,
and flows south-westward, at first through a park-like
valley, then cuts a deep cañon through the Mesa
Verde, and finally traverses an open plain to join the
San Juan. In the valley between the mountains
and the mesa, there are abundant shapeless mounds
of débris, which on examination are found to represent
blocks of square buildings and circular enclosures
all of adobe, very similar apparently to what
we have seen in the Salado valley of Arizona. There
is another resemblance to the southern remains in
the shape of indented and painted pottery, strewn
in great abundance about every mound, in fragments
rarely larger than a dollar,&mdash;not a greenback, but a
silver dollar, the former being no standard for archæological
comparisons. I shall make no further mention
of pottery; the reader may understand that in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_720">720</a></span>
this whole region, as in Arizona and New Mexico, it
is found in great quantities about every ruin that is
to be mentioned.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RIO DE LOS MANCOS.</p>

<p>The cañon through the Mesa Verde is on an
average two hundred yards wide, and from six hundred
to a thousand feet deep, with sides presenting,
as Mr Jackson says, "a succession of benches, one
above the other, and connected by the steep slopes of
the talus. Side-cañons penetrate the mesa, and ramify
it in every direction, always presenting a perpendicular
face, so that it is only at very rare intervals
that the top can be reached." Mr Ingersoll says:
"Imagine East River a thousand or twelve hundred
feet deep, and drained dry, the piers and slips on both
sides made of red sandstone, and extending down to
that depth, and yourself at the bottom, gazing up for
human habitations far above you. In such a picture
you would have a tolerable idea of this Cañon of
the Rio Mancos." For four or five miles after entering
the cañon, the shapeless heaps of adobe débris
were of frequent occurrence on the banks of the
stream. The general characteristic was "a central
mass considerably higher and more massive than the
surrounding lines of subdivided squares. Small
buildings, not more than eight feet square, were
often found standing alone apparently." The high
central portion suggests a terraced structure like
the Casa Grande of the Gila. One of the buildings
on the bottom, measuring eight by ten feet, was of
sandstone blocks, about seven by twelve inches, and
four inches thick, laid in what seemed to be adobe
mortar. Somewhat further down the adobe ruins
were found often on projecting benches, or promontories
of the cliff, some fifty feet above the stream.
Here they were circular, with a depression in the
centre, and generally in pairs. Cave-like crevices
along the seams were often walled up in front, so as
to enclose a space sometimes twelve feet long, but
oftener forming "cupboard-like inclosures of about the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_721">721</a></span>
size of a bushel-basket." A small square, formed by
rough stone slabs, set up endways in the earth, was
also noticed.</p>

<img src="images/i721.jpg" width="550" height="468" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cliff House&mdash;Mancos Cañon.</p>
</div>

<p>The first stone building particularly described, and
one of the most wonderful found during the trip, is
that shown in the cut. The most wonderful thing
about it was its position in the face of the cliff several
hundred feet above the bottom, on a ledge ten
feet wide and twenty feet long, accessible only by
hard climbing with fingers and toes inserted in
crevices, or during the upper part of the ascent by
steps cut in the steep slope by the aborigines. The
cliff above overhangs the ledge, leaving a vertical
space of fifteen feet. The building occupies only
half the length of the ledge, and is now twelve feet
high in front, leaving it uncertain whether it originally
reached the overhanging cliff, or had an independent
roof. The ground plan shows a front
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_722">722</a></span>
room six by nine feet, and two rear rooms each
five by seven, projecting on one side so as to form
an L. There were two stories, as is shown by the
holes in the walls and fragments of floor-timbers.
A doorway, twenty by thirty inches and two feet
above the floor, led from one side of the front room
to the esplanade, and there was also a window about
a foot square in the lower story, and a window or
doorway in the second story corresponding to that
below. Opposite this upper opening was a smaller
one opening into a reservoir holding about two hogsheads
and a half, and formed by a semicircular wall
joining the cliff and the main wall of the house. A
line of projecting wooden pegs led from the window
down into the cistern. Small doorways afforded
communication between the apartments. The front
portion was built of square and smoothly faced sandstone
blocks of different sizes, up to fifteen inches
long and eight inches thick, laid in a hard grayish-white
mortar, very compact and hard, but cracked on
the surface like adobe mortars. The rear portions
were of rough stones in mortar, and the partition
walls were like the exterior front ones, and seemed
to have been rubbed smooth after they were laid.</p>

<p>The interior of the front rooms was plastered with
a coating of a firm cement an eighth of an inch thick,
colored red, and having a white band eight inches
wide extending round the bottom like a base-board.
There were no other signs of decoration. The floor
was the natural rock of the ledge, evened up in some
places with cement. The lintel of the upper doorway
or window was of small straight cedar sticks laid
close together, and supporting the masonry above;
the other lintels seem to be of stone. A very wonderful
feature of this structure was that the front wall
rests on the rounded edge of the precipice, sloping at
an angle of forty-five degrees, and the esplanade, or
platform, at the side of the house was also leveled up
by three abutments resting on this slope, where "it
would seem that a pound's weight might slide them off."

<p class="caption">Round Tower&mdash;Mancos Cañon.</p>
</div>

<p>The cut shows the ground plan of a round stone
tower of peculiar form. The diameter is twenty-five
feet, and that of the inner circle twelve feet,<a id="FNanchor_XII-43" href="#Footnote_XII-43" class="fnanchor">[XII-43]</a> the
walls being eighteen and twelve inches thick, standing
in places fifteen feet high on the outside and eight
feet on the inside. This tower stands in the centre
of a group of faintly traced remains extending twenty
rods in every direction. The stones of which it was
built are irregular in size, laid in mortar, and chinked
with small pieces. The cut presents a view of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_724">724</a></span>
tower. The next cut illustrates the small cliff-houses
very common in the walls of the cañon. This and
its companions are from fifty to a hundred feet above
the trail; it is five by fifteen feet and six feet high,
the blocks composing the walls being very regular
and well laid. Some of these houses were mere walls
in front of crevices in the cliff. So strong are the
structures that in one place a part of the cliff had become
detached by some convulsion, and stood inclined
at quite an angle, taking with it a part of one of the
walls, but without overthrowing it. Small apertures
are so placed in all these cliff-structures as to afford a
look-out far up and down the valley. Rude inscriptions
are scratched on the cliff in many places, bearing
a general resemblance to those farther south, of
which I have given many illustrations.</p>

<p class="caption">Cliff-Dwelling&mdash;Mancos Cañon.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most inaccessible of the cliff-buildings
is shown in the cut. It is eight hundred feet high,
and can only be reached by climbing to the top of the
mesa, and creeping on hands and knees down a ledge
only twenty inches wide. The masonry was very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_725">725</a></span>
perfect, the blocks sixteen by three inches, ground
perfectly smooth on the inside so as to require no
plaster. The dimensions were about five by fifteen
feet, and seven feet high. The aperture serving as
doorway and window was twenty by thirty inches and
had a stone lintel. Near by but higher on the ledge
was another ruder building. These raised structures
were invariably on the western side of the cañon, but
those on the bottom were scattered on both sides of
the river.</p>

<p class="caption">Cliff-Dwelling&mdash;Mancos Cañon.</p>
</div>

<p>On the bottom "the majority of the buildings were
square, but many round, and one sort of ruin always
showed two square buildings with very deep cellars
under them and a round tower between them, seemingly
for watch and defence. In several cases a large
part of this tower was still standing." One of these
typical structures is shown in the following cut. It
is twelve feet in diameter, twenty feet high, with walls
sixteen inches thick. The window facing northward
is eighteen by twenty-four inches. The two apartments
adjoining the tower, the remains of which are
shown in the cut, are about fifteen feet square. They
seem to have been originally underground structures,
or at least partially so.</p>

</div>

<p>At the outlet of the cañon the river turns westward,
flowing for a time nearly parallel with the San
Juan, which it joins very nearly at the corner of the
four territories. Many groups of walls and heaps
were visible in the distance down the valley, but the
explorers left the river at this point and bore away to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_726">726</a></span>
the right along the foot of the mesa until they reached
Aztec Spring, very near the boundary line. "Immediately
adjoining the spring, on the right, as we face
it from below, is the ruin of a great massive structure
of some kind, about one hundred feet square in exterior
dimensions; a portion only of the wall upon the
northern face remaining in its original position. The
débris of the ruin now forms a great mound of crumbling
rock, from twelve to twenty feet in height, overgrown
with artimisia, but showing clearly, however,
its rectangular structure, adjusted approximately to
the four points of the compass. Inside this square
was a circle, about sixty feet in diameter, deeply depressed
in the centre, and walled. The space between
the square and the circle appeared, upon a hasty examination,
to have been filled in solidly with a sort
of rubble-masonry. Cross-walls were noticed in two
places; but whether they were to strengthen the walls
or had divided apartments could only be conjectured.
That portion of the outer wall remaining standing
was some forty feet in length and fifteen in height.
The stones were dressed to a uniform size and finish.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_727">727</a></span>
Upon the same level as this ruin, and extending back,
I should think, half a mile, were grouped line after
line of foundations and mounds, the great mass of
which was of stone, but not one remaining upon
another. All the subdivisions were plainly marked,
so that one might, with a little care, count every room
or building in the settlement. Below the above
group, some two hundred yards distant, and communicating
by indistinct lines of débris, was another
great wall, inclosing a space of about two hundred
feet square. Only a small portion was well enough
preserved to enable us to judge, with any accuracy,
as to its character and dimensions; the greater portion
consisting of large ridges flattened down so much
as to measure some thirty or more feet across the base,
and five or six feet in height. This better preserved
portion was some fifty feet in length, seven or eight
feet in height, and twenty feet thick, the two exterior
surfaces of well-dressed and evenly-laid courses, and
the centre packed in solidly with rubble-masonry,
looking entirely different from those rooms which had
been filled with débris, though it is difficult to assign
any reason for its being so massively constructed. It
was only a portion of a system extending half a mile
out into the plains, of much less importance, however,
and now only indistinguishable mounds. The town
built about this spring was nearly a square mile in
extent, the larger and more enduring buildings in the
centre, while all about were scattered and grouped
the remnants of smaller structures, comprising the
suburbs."</p>

<p>Four miles from the spring is the McElmo, a small
stream, dry during a greater part of the year. At
the point where the party struck this stream, portions
of walls, and heaps of débris in rectangular order
were scattered in every direction; among which two
round towers were noticed, one of them with double
walls, like that on the Mancos, but larger, being fifty
feet in diameter. Following down the McElmo cañon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_728">728</a></span>
aboriginal vestiges continue abundant, including cliff-dwellings
like those that have been described, but
only forty or fifty feet above the valley, and also the
square tower shown in first cut. It stands on a square
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_729">729</a></span>
detached block of sandstone forty feet in height.
The walls of this building were still fifteen feet high
in some places, and there were also traces of walls
about the base of the rock. Another double-walled
round tower fifty feet in diameter found near the one
last named is shown in the second cut.</p>

<p>Still further down the cañon, across the boundary
line into Utah, ruins continue abundant. A red
sandstone butte standing in the middle of the valley,
one hundred feet high and three hundred long, has
traces of masonry on its summit, apparently intended
to form a level platform, and on one side, at mid-height,
the structures shown in the cut. The upper
wall is eighteen feet long and twelve feet high, and
the blocks composing it are described as more regularly
cut than any before seen. The only access to
the summit of the butte was by climbing through
the window of the building. Other remains, including
many circular depressions of considerable depth,
and a square tower with one round corner, are scattered
about near the base of this butte, or <i>cristone</i>.
The next cut shows one of the cave-dwellings near by,
formed by walling up the front of a recess in the

<p class="sidenote">ABORIGINAL TRADITION</p>

<p>The tradition relating to the whole, and particularly
to this locality, obtained by Capt. Moss from
one of the old men among the Moquis, is rendered
by Mr Ingersoll as follows:&mdash;"Formerly the aborigines
inhabited all this country we had been over
as far west as the head waters of the San Juan, as
far north as the Rio Dolores, west some distance into
Utah, and south and south-west throughout Arizona,
and on down into Mexico. They had lived there
from time immemorial&mdash;since the earth was a small
island, which augmented as its inhabitants multiplied.
They cultivated the valley, fashioned whatever
utensils and tools they needed, very neatly and
handsomely out of clay and wood and stone, not
knowing any of the useful metals, built their homes
and kept their flocks and herds in the fertile river
bottoms, and worshiped the sun. They were an eminently
peaceful and prosperous people, living by agriculture
rather than by the chase. About a thousand
years ago, however, they were visited by savage
strangers from the North, whom they treated hospitably.
Soon these visits became more frequent and
annoying. Then their troublesome neighbors&mdash;ancestors
of the present Utes&mdash;began to forage upon them,
and at last to massacre them and devastate their
farms; so, to save their lives at least, they built
houses high upon the cliffs, where they could store
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_731">731</a></span>
food and hide away till the raiders left. But one
Summer the invaders did not go back to their mountains
as the people expected, but brought their families
with them and settled down. So driven from
their homes and lands, starving in their little niches
on the high cliffs, they could only steal away during
the night, and wander across the cheerless uplands.
To one who has traveled these steppes, such a flight
seems terrible, and the mind hesitates to picture the
suffering of the sad fugitives.</p>

<p>"At the christone they halted and probably found
friends, for the rocks and caves are full of the nests
of these human wrens and swallows. Here they
collected, erected stone fortifications and watch-towers,
dug reservoirs in the rocks to hold a supply
of water, which in all cases is precarious in this latitude,
and once more stood at bay. Their foes came,
and for one long month fought and were beaten back,
and returned day after day to the attack as merciless
and inevitable as the tide. Meanwhile the families
of the defenders were evacuating and moving south,
and bravely did their protectors shield them till they
were all safely a hundred miles away. The besiegers
were beaten back and went away. But the narrative
tells us that the hollows of the rocks were filled
to the brim with the mingled blood of conquerors and
conquered, and red veins of it ran down into the
cañon. It was such a victory as they could not
afford to gain again, and they were glad when the
long fight was over to follow their wives and little
ones to the South. There in the deserts of Arizona,
on well-nigh unapproachable isolated bluffs, they
built new towns, and their few descendants&mdash;the
Moquis&mdash;live in them to this day, preserving more
carefully and purely the history and veneration of
their forefathers, than their skill or wisdom." One
watch-tower in this region was built on a block of
sandstone that had rolled down and lodged on the very
brink of a precipice overlooking the whole valley.

<p class="sidenote">HOVENWEEP RUINS.</p>

<p>From the McElmo Mr Jackson and his party
struck off westward to a small stream called the
Hovenweep, eight or ten miles distant. Here they
found a ruined town, of which a general view is
given in the cut. Mr Jackson's description is as
follows: "The stream referred to sweeps the foot of
a rocky sandstone ledge, some forty or fifty feet in
height, upon which is built the highest and better-preserved
portions of the settlement. Its semicircular
sweep conforms to the ledge; each little house
of the outer circle being built close upon its edge.
Below the level of these upper houses, some ten or
twelve feet, and within the semicircular sweep, were
seven distinctly-marked depressions, each separated
from the other by rocky débris, the lower or first
series probably of a small community-house. Upon
either flank, and founded upon rocks, were buildings
similar in size and in other respects to the large ones
on the line above. As paced off, the upper or convex
surface measured one hundred yards in length.
Each little apartment was small and narrow, averaging
six feet in width and eight feet in length, the
walls being eighteen inches in thickness. The stones
of which the entire group was built were dressed to
nearly uniform size and laid in mortar. A peculiar
feature here was in the round corners, one at least
appearing upon nearly every little house. They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_733">733</a></span>
were turned with considerable care and skill; being
two curves, all the corners were solidly bound together
and resisted the destroying influences the
longest." The following cut presents a ground plan
of this Hovenweep Pueblo town, and terminates the
account of one of the most interesting antiquarian
explorations of modern times.</p>

<p>I append a few brief quotations from the diary of
Padres Dominguez and Escalante, who penetrated
probably as far as Utah Lake in early times, referring
to three places where ruins were seen, two of which
cannot readily be located. On the Dolores River "on
the southern bank of the river, on a height, there was
anciently a small settlement of the same plan as those
of the Indians of New Mexico, as is shown by the
ruins which we examined." A ruin is also located
on this river at the southern bend, on the U. S. map
of 1868. On the Rio de San Cosme, "we saw near
by a ruin of a very ancient town, in which were
fragments of metates, and pottery. The form of the
town was circular as shown by the ruins now almost
entirely leveled to the ground." In the cañon of
Santa Delfina "towards the south, there is quite a
high cliff, on which we saw rudely painted three
shields, and a spear-head. Lower down on the north
side we saw another painting which represented in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_734">734</a></span>
confused manner two men fighting, for which reason
we named it the Cañon Pintado."<a id="FNanchor_XII-44" href="#Footnote_XII-44" class="fnanchor">[XII-44]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In Idaho and Montana I have no record of ancient
remains, save a cliff at Pend d'Oreille Lake, on which

superstition and dread, regarding the figures as the

<p class="p2">In Washington, besides some shell ornaments and
arrow-heads of flint and other hard stone dug by Mr
Lord from a gravel bank near the old Fort Walla
Walla, and some rude figures mostly representing
men carved and afterwards painted on a perpendicular
rock between the Yakima and Pisquouse, pointed out
by a native to Mr Gibbs,<a id="FNanchor_XII-51" href="#Footnote_XII-51" class="fnanchor">[XII-51]</a> there seem to be remains
of antiquity in only two localities. The first are the
mounds on Bute Prairie, south of Olympia. They
were first found, or mentioned, by Wilkes in the U.
S. Exploring Expedition, in 1841, who describes them
as thousands in number arranged in fives like the
'five spots' on a playing card, formed by scraping together
the surface earth, about thirty feet in diameter
and six or seven feet high. Three of them were
opened, but proved to contain nothing but a pavement
of round stones in the centre and at the bottom, resting
on the subsoil of red gravel. The natives said
that the medicine men in later times were wont to
gather herbs from their surface, as being more potent
to work their cures than those growing elsewhere.
Since Wilkes' visit the newspapers have reported the
discovery of a large mound at the south end of the
prairie, twenty-five miles from Olympia, which is three
hundred feet high and nine hundred feet in diameter
at the base. These later reports state also that all
the small mounds opened in recent times have been
found to contain remains of pottery and "other curious
relics, evidently the work of human hands."<a id="FNanchor_XII-52" href="#Footnote_XII-52" class="fnanchor">[XII-52]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_736">736</a></span></p>

<p>The second locality where remains are found is on
the lower Yakima River, where Mr Stephens saw an
earth-work consisting of two concentric circles of earth
about three feet high with a ditch between them.
The outer circle is eighty yards in diameter, and
within the inner one are about twenty cellars, or excavations,
thirty feet across and three feet deep, like
the cellars of modern native houses scattered over the
country without, however, any enclosing circles.
These works are located on a terrace about fifteen feet
high, bounded on either side by a gulley.<a id="FNanchor_XII-53" href="#Footnote_XII-53" class="fnanchor">[XII-53]</a></p>

<p>Other British Columbian antiquities consist of
shell mounds, burial mounds, and earth-works, chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_737">737</a></span>
confined to Vancouver Island, and known to me
through the investigations and writings of Mr James
Deans. Mr Deans has lived long in the country, is
perfectly familiar with it and its natives, and has
given particular attention to the subject of antiquities.
He makes no great pretensions as a writer, but
has made notes of his discoveries from time to time,
and has furnished his manuscripts for my use under
the title of <i>Ancient Remains in Vancouver Island and
British Columbia</i>. Like other explorers, he has not
been able to resist the temptation to theorize without
sufficient data on questions of ethnology and the
origin of the American aborigines, but his speculations
do not diminish the value of his explorations,
and are far from being as absurd as those of many
authors who are much better known.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">VANCOUVER ISLAND.</p>

<p class="p2">Burial mounds on Vancouver Island are of two
classes, according as they are constructed chiefly of
sand and gravel or of stones. One of the first class
opened by Mr Deans in 1871, will illustrate the construction
of all. It was located on the second terrace
from the sea, the terraces having nearly perpendicular
banks of fifty and sixty feet respectively.
By a carefully cut drift through the centre, it was
ascertained to have been made in the following manner.
First, a circle sixteen feet in diameter was
marked out, and the top soil cleared off within the
circle; then a basin-shaped hole, six feet in diameter,
smaller at the bottom than at the top, was dug in
the centre, in which the skull, face down, and the
larger unburned bones were placed and covered with
six inches of earth. On the layer of earth rested a
large flat stone, on which were heaped up loose
stones, the heap extending about a foot beyond the
circumference of the central hole. Outside of this
heap, on the surface, a space two feet wide extending
round the whole circumference was sprinkled with
ashes, and contained a few bones also. Outside of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_738">738</a></span>
this space again, large stones two or three feet long
were set up in the ground like pillars, five feet apart,
round the circumference; and finally the earth dug
from the central hole, or receptacle for the bones, was
thrown into the outer circle, and gravel and sand
added to the whole until the mound was five feet
high, having a rounded form. Four smaller mounds,
six and ten feet in diameter, were opened in the
same group, showing the same mode of construction,
but somewhat less order.</p>

<p>The second class, or stone mounds, which are much
more numerous than those of earth, differ but little
from the others in their construction, except that the
final additions to the mound were of stones instead of
earth, and the stones about the circumference were
flat and set up close together. A piece of quartz
sometimes accompanies the bones, but no other relics
are found. When the skeleton is deposited face
down, as is usually the case, the skull is placed
toward the south, or when in a sitting position, it
faces the south, seeming in some cases to have been
burned where it sat. In a few instances the skeleton,
when it was but little burned, was lying on the
left side. The human bones invariably crumbled at
a touch, and the author states that this method of
burial is altogether unknown to the present inhabitants,
who say their ancestors found them as they
are.</p>

<p>The mounds are often overgrown with large pine,
arbutus, or oak trees; in one case an oak had forced
its way up through the stones in its growth, reached
its full size, decayed, and the stones had fallen back
over the stump. They are often in groups, and in
such cases the central one is always most carefully
constructed, and a remarkable circumstance is that
sometimes the surrounding heaps contain only children's
bones. Of course this suggests a sacrifice of
children or slaves at a chief's funeral, although there
may be some other explanation. Some stones weighing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_739">739</a></span>
a ton are found over the human remains. Traces
of cedar bark or boards are found in some of the
cairns, in which the bones were apparently enclosed;
and in a few others a small empty chamber was
formed over the flat covering stone.</p>

<p>Near Comox, one hundred and thirty miles north-west
of Victoria, a group of mounds were examined
in 1872-3, and found to be built of sea sand and black
mold, mixed with some shells. They were from five
to fifty yards in circumference. In one by the side
of a very large skull was deposited a piece of coal;
and in another with a very peculiar flattened skull
was a child's tooth. Both these skulls are said to
have been covered with baked clay, and are now in
the collection of the Society of Natural History in
Montreal. One mound in this vicinity is fifty feet
high and of oval shape. In its centre only a few feet
below the surface were found burnt skeletons of children
not over twelve years old, which seemed to have
been enclosed in a box of cedar&mdash;of which only a brown
dust remains&mdash;and covered with two feet of stones
and one foot of shells. There is a spring of fine
water some fifty yards from this mound, of which,
from superstitious motives no Indian will drink. One
rectangular cairn, ten by twelve feet, was found, but
even in this the central receptacle was circular. The
body in this mound showed no signs of burning, the
head pointed northward, and a pencil-shaped stone
sharp at both ends was deposited with the human
remains.</p>

<p class="p2">Shell mounds are described as very abundant
throughout Vancouver Island, and also on the mainland,
and all are composed of species of shells still
common in the coast waters. One at Comox covers
three acres, and is from two to fourteen feet deep.
The relics discovered in mounds of this class include
stone hammers; arrow-points of flint, slate, and of a
hard green stone; spear-heads, knives, needles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_740">740</a></span>
awls, of stone and bone, one of the knives being sixteen
inches long and of whale-bone; bone wedges,
sometimes grooved; and finally stone mortars, comparatively
few in number, since acorns and seeds
were not apparently a favorite article of food. Human
skeletons also occur in the shell mounds. At
Comox a skeleton is said to have been found with a
bone knife broken off in one of the bones. A shell
bracelet was taken from a mound at Esquimalt; and
from another was dug a stone dish or paint-pot,
carved to represent a man holding a mountain sheep.
The man was the handle on one side, the sheep's head
on the other, and the cup was hollowed out in the
sheep's back. Mr Deans believes he can distinguish
two distinct types of skulls in Vancouver Island&mdash;the
'long-headed' in the older cairns, and the 'broad-headed'
in the shell mounds and modern graves: and
this distinction is independent of artificial flattening,
which it seems was practiced in a majority of cases
on skulls of both types.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">EARTH-WORKS.</p>

<p class="p2">In addition to the mounds, Mr Deans states that
earth-works very similar to those found in the eastern
states are found at many localities in British
Columbia. Indeed, he has sent me several plans, cut
from Squier's work on the antiquities of New York,
which by a simple change in the names of creeks and
in the scale would represent equally well the north-western
works. At Beacon Hill, near Victoria, a
point one hundred feet high extends three hundred
feet into the sea; an embankment with a ditch still
six feet deep, stretches across on the land side and
protects the approach; there are low mounds on the
enclosed area, the remnants of ancient dwellings, and
down the steep banks are heaps of shells, with ashes,
bones of sea-fowl, deer, elk, and bears, among which
are some spear and arrow points, needles, etc. On
the summit of Beacon Hill, near by, are burial cairns
of the usual type.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_741">741</a></span></p>

<p>Another earth-work was examined by Mr Deans at
Baines Sound and Deep Bay. This was an oval embankment
surrounded at the base by a ditch, close to
the water on the bay side, but now seventy yards from
high-water mark on the side next the sound, although
originally at the water edge. From the bottom of
the ditch to the top of the embankment or mound is
forty feet, and at the summit a parapet bank now four
feet high encloses an area of over an acre. On the
sound side is an opening from which a road runs down
the slope of the mound and across the ditch by a kind
of earthen bridge. Excavation showed a depth of
nine feet of shells, ashes, and black loam. Many
burial mounds are scattered about which have not
been opened.</p>

<p>I am inclined to regard Mr Deans' reports as trustworthy,
although of course additional authorities are
required before the accuracy of his observations respecting
the burial mounds, and the existence of earthworks
bearing a strong resemblance, as he claims, to
those of the eastern states can be fully accepted.
Respecting the mounds I quote in a note from Mr
Forbes, the only other authority I have been able to
find on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_XII-55" href="#Footnote_XII-55" class="fnanchor">[XII-55]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_742">742</a></span></p>

<p>In Alaska I find no record of any antiquities
whatever, although many curious specimens of aboriginal
art, made by the natives still inhabiting the
country since the coming of Europeans, have been
brought away by travelers. Cook saw in the country
several artificial stone hillocks, which seemed to him
of great antiquity, but he also noted that each native
added a stone to burial heaps on passing; and
Schewyrin and Durnew found on one of the
Aleutian Islands three round copper plates bearing
letters and leaf-work, said to have been thrown up
by the sea; but I suppose there is no evidence that
they were of aboriginal origin.<a id="FNanchor_XII-56" href="#Footnote_XII-56" class="fnanchor">[XII-56]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p class="p2">Thus have I gone over the whole extent of the
Pacific States from the southern isthmus to Bering
Strait, carefully examining, so far as written records
could enable me to do so, every foot of this broad
territory, in search for the handiwork of its aboriginal
inhabitants. Practically I have given in the
preceding pages all that has been written on the
subject. Before a perfect account of all that the
Native Races have left can be written, before material
relics can reveal all they have to tell about the
peoples whose work they are, a long and patient
work of exploration and study must be performed&mdash;a
work hardly commenced yet even in the thickly
populated centres of old world learning, and still less
advanced naturally in the broad new fields and forests
of the Far West. In this volume the general reader
may find an accurate and comprehensive if not a
very fascinating picture of all that aboriginal art has
produced; the student of ethnological topics may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_743">743</a></span>
found his theories on all that is known respecting any
particular monument here spread before him, rather
than on a partial knowledge derived by long study
from the accounts in works to which he has access,
contradicted very likely in other works not consulted,&mdash;and
many a writer has subjected himself to ridicule
by resting an important part of his favorite
theory on a discovery by Smith, which has been
proved an error or a hoax by Jones and Brown; the
antiquarian student may save himself some years of
hard labor in searching between five hundred and a
thousand volumes for information to which he is here
guided directly, even if he be unwilling to take his
information at second hand; and finally, the explorer
who proposes to examine a certain section of the
country, may acquaint himself by a few hours' reading
with all that previous explorers have done or
failed to do, and by having his attention specially
called to their work will be able to correct their
errors and supply what they have neglected.</p>

<p>If the work in this volume shall prove to have
been sufficiently well done to serve, in the manner
indicated above, as a safe foundation for systematic
antiquarian research in the future, the author's aim
will be realized and his labor amply repaid.

<p class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF FOREIGN REMAINS.</p>

<p>I announced in an introductory chapter my intention
to go in this volume beyond the geographical
limits of my field of labor proper, the Pacific States,
and to include a sketch of eastern and southern antiquities.
I am not sure that this departure from my
territory is strictly more necessary or appropriate in
this than in the other departments of this work;&mdash;that
is, that the material relics of the Mississippi
Valley and South America have a more direct bearing
on the institutions and history of the Native
Races of the Pacific, than do the manners and customs,
mythology, and language of the South American
and eastern tribes. Yet there is this difference,
that to have included the whole American continent
in the preceding volumes would have required a new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_745">745</a></span>
collection of material, additional time and research,
and an increase of bulk in printed pages, each equal
at least to what has been done; and I believe that the
original scope of my work, and the bulk of that part
of it devoted to the Native Races, is already sufficiently
extensive. But in the department of antiquities,
making the present volume of uniform size with
others of the work, I have, I think, sufficient space
and material to justify me in extending my researches
beyond the Pacific States; and this seems to me especially
desirable by reason of the fact that all the
important archæological remains outside of what I
term the Pacific States, may be included in the two
groups to which my closing chapters are devoted, and
the present volume may consequently present some
claim to be considered a comprehensive work on American
Antiquities.</p>

<p class="p2">My treatment of the subject in this and the following
chapter will, however, differ considerably from
that in those preceding. I have hitherto proceeded
geographically from south to north, placing before the
reader all the information extant, be it more or less
complete, respecting every relic in each locality, and
giving besides in every case the source whence the
information was obtained. In this manner the notes
become a complete bibliographical index to the whole
subject, not an unimportant feature, I believe, of this
work. In the broad eastern region bordering on the
Mississippi and its tributaries, a region thickly inhabited,
and thoroughly explored by antiquarians, or at
least comparatively so, so numerous are the relics and
the localities where they have been found, that to
take them up one after another for detailed description
would require at least a volume; and these relics,
although of great importance, present so little variety
in the absence of all architectural monuments, that
such a detailed account could hardly fail to become
monotonous to a degree unparalleled even in the pages
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_746">746</a></span>
of the present volume. Moreover, the books and
other material in my possession, while amply sufficient,
I think, to furnish a clear idea of the Mississippi
and South American monuments, are of course
inadequate to a continuation of the bibliographical
feature referred to. For these reasons I deem it best
to abandon the elaborate note-system hitherto followed,
and shall present a general rather than a detailed
view of material relics outside the Pacific
States, formed from a careful study of what I believe
to be the best authorities, and illustrated by the cuts
given in Mr Baldwin's work.<a id="FNanchor_XIII-1" href="#Footnote_XIII-1" class="fnanchor">[XIII-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.</p>

<p class="p2">Material relics of the aboriginal tribes are found in
greater or less abundance throughout the Eastern
United States and the Canadas. But those found in
New England and the region east of the Alleghanies,
extending southward to the Carolinas, may be dismissed
in an account so general as the present with
the remark that all are evidently the work of the Indian
tribes found in possession of the country, many
of them evidently and others probably having originated
at a time subsequent to the coming of Europeans.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_747">747</a></span>
But whatever may be decided respecting
their antiquity, it may be regarded as absolutely certain
that none of them point to the existence of any
people of more advanced culture than the red race
that came in contact with Europeans. They consist
for the most part of traces of Indian villages or
camps, burial grounds, small stone-heaps, scattered
arrow-heads, and some other rude stone implements.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CLASSIFICATION OF REMAINS.</p>

<p class="p2">The great Mississippi Valley system of ancient works,
consisting of mounds and embankments of earth and
stone, erected by the race known as the Mound-builders,
extends over a territory bounded in general terms
as follows: on the north by the great lakes; on the
east by western New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia
in the north, but farther south extending to the
Atlantic coast and including Florida, Georgia, and part
of South Carolina; on the south by the Gulf of Mexico,
including Texas according to the general statements
of most writers, although I find no definite account of
any remains in that state; on the west by an indefinite
line extending from the head of Lake Superior through
the states of Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Indian
Territory, although there are reported some remains
farther west, particularly on the upper Missouri,
which have not been thoroughly explored. The
map in the accompanying cut is intended only to show
the reader at a glance the relative position of the
states in the territory of the Mound-builders.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i748"></a>
<img src="images/i748.jpg" width="421" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Map of the Territory of the Mound-Builders.</p>
</div>

<p>Throughout this broad extent of territory, but
chiefly on the fertile river-terraces of the Mississippi
and its tributaries, the works of the ancient inhabitants
are found in great abundance, and may be classified
for convenience in description as follows:&mdash;I.
Embankments of earth or stone, and ditches, often
forming enclosures, which are subdivided by their
location into, 1st, fortifications, and 2d, sacred enclosures,
or such as are supposed to have been connected
with religious rites.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_748">748</a></span></p>

<p>II. Mounds of earth or stone, of varying location,
size, form, material, and contents; divided by their
form into, 1st, 'temple mounds,' of regular outline
and large dimensions, having flat summit platforms,
and often terraced sides with graded ascents; 2d,
'animal-mounds,' or those resembling in their ground
plan the forms of animals, birds, or even human
beings; and 3d, conical mounds, which are again
subdivided according to their contents into 'altar-mounds'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_749">749</a></span>
or 'sacrificial mounds,' 'burial mounds,' and
'anomalous mounds,' or such as are of mixed or undetermined
character.</p>

<p>III. Minor relics of aboriginal art, for the most
part taken from the mounds, including implements
and ornaments of metal, stone, shell, and bone.</p>

<p>IV. Ancient mines, and perhaps a few salt-wells
which bear marks of having been worked by the
aborigines.</p>

<p>V. Rock-inscriptions.</p>

<p>These different classes of remains, although sufficiently
uniform in their general character to indicate
that the Mound-builders were of one race, living
under one grand system of institutions, still show
certain variations in the relative predominance of
each class in different sections of the territory. The
Ohio River and its tributaries would seem to have
been in a certain sense the centre of the Mound-builders'
power, for here the various forms of enclosures
and mounds are most abundant and extensive,
and their contents show the highest advancement
of aboriginal art. This section, including
chiefly the state of Ohio, but also parts of Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois, and Missouri,
was the ground embraced in the explorations of
Squier and Davis, by far the best authorities on eastern
antiquities. In the northern region, on the great
lakes, on which Lapham and Pidgeon are the prominent
authorities, chiefly in Wisconsin, but also in
Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota,
animal-mounds are the prominent feature, the other
classes of mounds, and the enclosures, being of
comparatively rare occurrence. The animal-mounds
occur in the central Ohio region only in a very few
instances, and never, so far as is known, in the south.
In the southern or gulf states the temple-mounds
are more numerous in proportion to other classes
than in the north, and enclosures disappear almost
altogether. The southern antiquities have, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_750">750</a></span>
been comparatively little explored, Mr Jones' late
work referring for the most part only to the state of
Georgia.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole region traces of the tribes
found by Europeans in possession of the country are
found; and besides the three territorial divisions
already indicated, it is noted that in the north-east,
in western New York and Pennsylvania, the works
of the Mound-builders merge so gradually into those
of the later tribes, the only relics farther east, that it
becomes well-nigh impossible to fix accurately the
dividing line.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">REMAINS IN NEW YORK.</p>

<p class="p2">In many parts of western New York traces are
found of Indian fortified camps, surrounded by rows
of holes in the ground, which once supported palisades,
and in all respects similar to those in use
among the Indians of the state in their wars against
the whites. There are also found low embankments
of earth, or very rarely of small stones, which form
enclosures or cut off the approach to the weaker side
of some naturally strong position. Such embankments
are always on hills, lake or river terraces, or other high
places, and are often protected on one or more sides by
morasses or by streams with steep banks. Their
strong natural position, with due regard to the water
supply, carefully planned means of exit, and in many
instances graded roads to the water, leaves no doubt of
their original design as fortifications, places of refuge
and of protection against enemies. The slight height
of the embankments would suggest that they were
thrown up to support palisades; indeed, traces of
these palisades have been found in some cases. The
practice of throwing up an embankment at the foot of
palisades, although seemingly a very natural one, does
not, however, seem to have been noticed among the
Indian tribes of New York. In nearly all the enclosures
remains of the typical Indian <i>caches</i> are
found, with carbonized maize, and traces of wood and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_751">751</a></span>
bark; and in and around them the sites of Indian
lodges or towns are seen, indicated by the presence of
decomposed and carbonaceous matter, together with
burned stones, charcoal, ashes, bones, pottery, and Indian
implements. These circumstances go far to
prove that all the New York works, if not built by
the Indians, were at least occupied by them after
their abandonment by the Mound-builders, from some
of whose works they do not differ much except in dimensions
and regularity of form.</p>

<p>The enclosures vary in extent from three to four
acres, the largest being sixteen acres. The embankments
are from one to four feet high, generally accompanied
by an exterior ditch;&mdash;the highest is seven or
eight feet from bottom of ditch to top of embankment.
Many such works in a country so long under
cultivation have of course disappeared. Mr Squier
ascertained the locality of one hundred of them in
New York, and estimates the original number at not
less than two hundred and fifty.</p>

<p class="p2">The works of the Mound-builders are almost exclusively
confined to the fertile valleys still best fitted
to support a dense population. The Mississippi and
its tributaries have during the progress of the centuries
worn down their valleys in three or four successive
terraces, which, except the lowest, or latest
formed, the ancient peoples chose as the site of their
structures, giving the preference in rearing their
grandest cities&mdash;for cities there must have been&mdash;to
the terrace plains near the junction of the larger
streams. On these plains and their surrounding
heights, are found the ancient monuments, generally in
groups which include all or many of the classes named
above; for it is only for convenience in description
that the classification is made; that is, the classification
is by no means to any great extent a geographical
one. I have already said that Ohio was the
centre, apparently, of the Mound-builders' power.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_752">752</a></span>
Northward, eastward, and perhaps westward from
this centre, the works diminish in extent, fortifications
become a more prominent feature, and the remaining
monuments approximate perceptibly to those
of the more barbarous and later peoples. In fact, we
find the modifications that might naturally be expected
in a frontier country. Southward from the
Ohio region down the Mississippi Valley, it is a common
remark in the various writings on the subject,
that the monuments increase gradually in magnitude
and numbers. This statement seems to have originated,
partially at least, in the old attempt to trace
the path of Aztec migration southward. The only
foundation for it is the fact that the class of mounds
called temple-mounds are in the south more numerous
in proportion to those of the other classes. The
largest mound and the most extensive groups are in
the north; while the complicated arrangement of sacred
enclosures appears but rarely if at all towards
the gulf. It is not impossible that more extensive
explorations may show that the comparative numbers
and size of the large temple-mounds have been somewhat
exaggerated. Yet the claims in behalf of Nahua
traces in the Mississippi region are much better
founded than those that have been urged in other
parts of the country; although we have seen that the
chain is interrupted in the New Mexican country,
and I can find no definite record of temple-mounds in
Texas. The total number of mounds in the state of
Ohio is estimated by the best authority at ten thousand,
while the enclosures were at least fifteen hundred.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">FORTIFICATIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">I begin with the embankments and enclosures.
They are found, almost always in connection with
mounds of some class, on the hills overlooking the
valleys, and on the ravine-bounded terraces left by
the current of rapid streams. The first, or oldest,
terraces, with bold banks from fifty to a hundred feet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_753">753</a></span>
high, furnish the sites of most of the works; on the
lower intermediate terraces, whose banks range from
ten to thirty feet in height, they are also found,
though less frequently than above; while on the last-formed
terrace below no monuments whatever have
ever been discovered.</p>

<p>The embankments are simply earth, stones, or a
mixture of the two, in their natural condition, thrown
up from the material which is nearest at hand.
There is no instance of walls built of stone that has
been hewn or otherwise artificially prepared, of the
use of mortar, of even rough stones laid with regularity,
of adobes or earth otherwise prepared, or of
material brought from any great distance. The material
was taken from a ditch that often accompanies
the embankment, from excavations or pits in the
immediate vicinity, or is scraped up from the surface
of the surrounding soil. There is nothing in the
present appearance of these works to indicate any
difference in their original form from that naturally
given to earth-works thrown up from a ditch, with
sides as nearly perpendicular as the nature of the
material will permit. Of course, any attempt on the
part of the builders to give a symmetrical superficial
contour to the works would have been long since
obliterated by the action of the elements; but nothing
now remains to show that they attached any
importance whatever to either material or contour.
Stone embankments are rarely found, and only in
localities where the abundance of the material would
naturally suggest its use. In a few instances clay
has been obtained at a little distance, or dug from
beneath the surface.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FORTIFIED HILLS.</p>

<p>Accordingly as they are found on the level plain,
or on hill-tops or other strong positions, enclosures
are divided into fortifications and sacred enclosures.
Of the design of the first class there can be no doubt,
and very little respecting many of the second class,
although it is very probable that some of the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_754">754</a></span>
had a different purpose, not now understood. Naturally
some works occur which have some of the
features of both classes. The fortifications are always
of irregular form as determined by the nature
of the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i754"></a>
<img src="images/i754.jpg" width="410" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fortification&mdash;Butler Hill.</p>
</div>

<p>A fortification at Butler Hill, near Hamilton,
Ohio, is shown in the cut. The summit of the hill
is two hundred and fifty feet above the river, the enclosing
wall is of earth and stones, five feet high,
thirty-five feet thick at the base, and unaccompanied
by a ditch, although there are some pits which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_755">755</a></span>
furnished the material of the wall. Two mounds or
heaps of rough stones are seen within the enclosure
and one without, the stones of all showing marks of
fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i755"></a>
<img src="images/i755.jpg" width="550" height="468" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fort Hill, Ohio.</p>
</div>

<p>The next cut shows a work at Fort Hill, Ohio,
which seems to unite the characters of the two
classes of enclosures. It measures twenty-eight
hundred by eighteen hundred feet, and is on the
second terrace. The wall along the creek side is of
stones and clay, four feet high: the other main walls
are six feet high and thirty-five feet thick, with an
exterior ditch. The walls of the square enclosure at
the side are of clay, present some marks of fire, and
have no ditch. Mr Squier concludes that this was a
fortified town rather than a fort like many others.
The walls of the enclosure shown in the following cut,
on Paint Creek, Ohio, are of stone, thirteen hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_756">756</a></span>
feet in circumference, and have no ditch. The
heaps of stones connected with this work have been
exposed to excessive heat, either perhaps by being
used as fire signals, or by the burning of wooden
structures which they supported. In the works at
Fort Ancient, on a mesa two hundred and thirty feet
above the Miami River, the embankment is four
miles long in an irregular line round the circumference,
and in some parts eighteen or twenty feet high.
There are also some signs of artificial terraces on the
river side of the hill. A line of these defensive
works is found in northern Ohio, with which very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_757">757</a></span>
few regular mounds or sacred enclosures are connected.
Pidgeon states that a single line of embankment
may be traced for seventeen miles, and that
there are three hundred and six miles of embankment
fortifications in the state. It is quite probable
that these embankments originally bore palisades.
They vary in height from three to thirty feet, reckoning
from the bottom of the ditch; but this gives only
a very imperfect idea of their original dimensions,
since in some localities the height has been much
more reduced by time than in others, owing to the
nature of the material. In hill fortifications the
ditch is usually inside the wall, but when the defences
guard the approach to a terrace-point, the
ditch is always on the outside. The entrances to
this class of enclosures are governed by convenience
of exit, accessibility of water, and facilities for
defence. They are usually guarded by overlapping
walls as shown in the cuts that have been presented.
Several of the larger fortifications, however, have a
large number of entrances, generally at regular intervals,
which it is very difficult to account for.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i756"></a>
<img src="images/i756.jpg" width="404" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fort near Bourneville.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote p2">SACRED ENCLOSURES.</p>

<p class="p2">Other enclosures are classed as sacred, or pertaining
in some way to religious rites, because no other equally
satisfactory explanation of their use can be given.
That they were in no sense works of defence is evident
from their position, almost invariably on the
most level spot that could be selected and often overlooked
by neighboring elevations. Unlike the fortifications
they are regular in form, the square and
circle predominating and generally found in conjunction,
but the ellipse, rectangle, crescent, and a great
variety of other forms being frequent, and several
different forms usually occurring together. A square
with one or more circles is a frequent combination.
The angles and curves are usually if not always perfectly
accurate, and the regular, or sacred, enclosures
probably outnumber by many the irregular ones, although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_758">758</a></span>
they are of lesser extent. Enclosed areas of
one to fifty acres are common. The groups are of
great extent; one at Newark, Ohio, covers an area
of nearly four square miles. A remarkable coincidence
was noticed by Mr Squier in the dimensions
of the square enclosures, five or six of these having
been found at long distances from each other, which
measured exactly ten hundred and eighty feet square.
Circles are, as a rule, smaller than the squares with
which they are connected, two hundred to two hundred
and fifty feet being a common size. The
largest of the enclosures, with an area of some six
hundred acres, are those reported in the far west
and north-west by early travelers whose reports are
not confirmed.</p>

<p>The embankment itself differs from those already
described only in being, as a rule, somewhat lower
and narrower, although at Newark one is thirty
feet high, and in being constructed with less exceptions
without the use of stones. The material as
before was taken from the surface, ditches, or from
pits, which latter are often described as wells, and
may in some instances have served as such.</p>

<p>The following cut represents a group at Liberty,
Ohio, typical of a large class in the Scioto Valley.
The location is on the third terrace, the embankments
of earth are not over four feet high, there is no ditch,
and the earth seems to have been taken exclusively
from pits, which, contrary to the usual custom, are
within the enclosure. The square is one of those
already spoken of as agreeing exactly in dimensions
with others at a distance. Additional dimensions are
shown in the cut. The enclosures, both square and
round, usually include several mounds. One at
Mound City, square with rounded corners, covering
thirteen acres, has twenty-four sacrificial mounds
within its walls. At Portsmouth, there are four concentric
circles, cut by four broad avenues facing, with
slight variation, the cardinal points, and having a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_759">759</a></span>
large terraced and truncated mound in the centre.
The banks of one enclosure near Newark measure thirty
feet in height from the bottom of the ditch; the usual
height is from three to seven feet.</p>

<p>The circles often have an interior ditch; in some
cases, as at Circleville and Salem, there are two circular
embankments one within the other with a
ditch between them; but there is only one instance
of an exterior ditch, in the work at Bourneville,
Ohio, shown in the first cut. The wall is from eight
to ten feet high, and the ditch is shallow. The larger
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_760"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_761">761</a></span>
circles have generally a single entrance, which is
usually, but not always, on the east. There are numerous
small circles from thirty to fifty feet in diameter,
found in connection with groups of large enclosures,
which have very light embankments and no
entrances. These may very likely be the remains of
lodges or camps. The larger circles are almost invariably
connected with squares or rectangles, which
have similar embankments but no ditches. These
have very commonly an entrance at each angle and
one in the middle of each side, but the larger squares
have often many more entrances.</p>

<p>The second cut shows a group of sacred enclosures
at Hopeton, Ohio, located on the third terrace. The
walls of the rectangle are of a clayey loam, fifty feet
thick and twelve feet high, without a ditch. The
summit is wide enough for a wagon road. The walls
of the circle are somewhat lower and composed of
clay differing in color from that found in the vicinity.
The two smaller circles have interior ditches. The
cut gives a view of the same works as they appear
from the east. The parallel embankments in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_762">762</a></span>
south are one hundred and fifty feet apart and extend
half a mile to the bank of an old river bed. Two
hundred paces north of the large circle, and not
shown in the cuts, is another circle two hundred and
fifty feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The enclosure shown in the next cut is that at
Cedar Bank, near Chillicothe, Ohio, and seems to
partake somewhat of the nature of a fortification.
The west side is naturally protected by the river
bank, and the other sides are enclosed by a wall and
ditch, each forty feet wide and five to six feet high
or deep. The bed of a small stream forms a natural
ditch for one half of the eastern side. Within the
enclosure in a line with the entrances is a raised
platform four feet high, measuring one hundred and
fifty by two hundred and fifty feet, with graded ways
thirty feet wide, leading to the summit. The parallels
outside the enclosure are three or four feet high.
The earth-work in Randolph County, Indiana, is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_763">763</a></span>
sufficiently explained by the cut. This work, like
the preceding, would seem to have been constructed
partially with a view to defence. The work shown
in the next cut is part of a group in Pike County,
Ohio. The circle is three hundred feet in diameter.

<p class="sidenote">EARTH-WORKS.</p>

<p>The different enclosures of a group are often connected
by parallel embankments. Similar embankments
protect the roads leading from fortified works
to the river bank or other source of water. Many
are not connected with any enclosures, though in
their vicinity; and in such cases they are very slight,
from seven hundred to eight hundred feet long, and
sixty to eighty feet apart. Some of these parallels
were very likely raised roads instead of enclosed ones,
as on the Little Miami River, where the embankments
extend about a quarter of a mile from two
mounds, forming a semicircle round a third, being a
rod wide and only three feet high. At Madison,
Louisiana, there is a raised way three feet high,
seventy-five feet wide, and two thousand seven hundred
feet long, with broad excavations three feet in
depth extending on both sides for about two thirds
its length. Two parallel banks at Piketon, Ohio, are
shown in the cut. They are ten hundred and eighty
feet long, two hundred and three feet apart at one
end, and two hundred and fifteen at the other; the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_765">765</a></span>
height on the outside being from five to eleven feet,
but on the inside twenty-two feet at one end. A
modern carriage road now runs between the mounds.
From the end of one of them a slight embankment
extends twenty-five hundred and eighty feet to a
group of mounds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DITCHES AND MOUNDS.</p>

<p>In the north ditches seem never to occur, except
with embankments; but in the south, where embankments
are rarely if ever found, ditches, or moats, are
sometimes employed to enclose other works, especially
in Georgia. Such a moat at Carterville communicates
with the river, extends to a pond perhaps
artificial, and has two reservoirs, each of an acre,
connected with it. The mounds and other monuments
are located between the river and the moat.
I have already spoken of the pits which furnished
earth for the various works, sometimes called wells;
some wells of another class, found in the bed of
streams and supplied with round covers, were found
by Mr Squier to be the natural casts of septaria, or
imbedded nodules of hard clay.</p>

<p class="p2">The mound or heap form is the one most common
in American antiquities as in those of nearly the
whole world. Mounds are found throughout the
Mississippi region as before bounded, and beyond its
limits in many directions they merge into the small
stone heaps which are known to have been thrown up
by the Indians at road-crossings and over graves.
They are most numerous in the upper Mississippi and
Ohio valleys, in the same region where the embankments
also most abound. As I have said, the number
in Ohio alone is estimated at more than ten thousand.
They are almost always found in connection
with embankments and other works of the different
classes described, but they are also very numerous in
regions where enclosures rarely or never occur, as in
Wisconsin and in the gulf states. From the central
region about the junction of the Mississippi, Missouri,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_766">766</a></span>
and Ohio, they gradually diminish in numbers in
every direction, and also in size except perhaps towards
the south. They are found in valley and plain,
on hill-side and hill-top; isolated and in groups; within
and without enclosures; and at long distances from
other works. By their location alone no satisfactory
classification could possibly be made; still, when considered
in connection with their contents and other
circumstances, their location assumes importance. By
their forms the tumuli are classified as temple-mounds,
animal-mounds, and conical mounds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEMPLE-MOUNDS.</p>

<p>Temple-mounds always have level summit platforms,
and are supposed to have once supported
wooden structures, although no traces of such temples
remain. A graded road straight or winding, of
gentler slope than the sides of the mound, often
leads to the top; and in many cases the sides have
one or more terraces. One in Tennessee, four
hundred and fifty feet in diameter and fifty feet
high, has ten clearly marked terraces, except on the
east. The bases assume a variety of forms, square,
rectangular, octagonal, round, oval, etc., but the
curves and angles are always extremely regular. In
the north they are usually within enclosures, but in
the south, where they are most numerous, they have
no embankments and are often arranged in groups,
the smaller about a larger central mound. In size
the temple-mounds vary from a height of five feet
and a diameter of forty feet to ninety feet in altitude
and a base-area of eight acres. In respect to form,
material, structure, contents, and probable use they
admit of no subdivision. Like the embankments
they are made of earth, or rarely of stones, simply
heaped up, with little care in the choice of material
and none at all in the order of deposit.</p>

<p>The largest mound of this, or in fact of any, class
is that at Cahokia, Illinois. Its base measures seven
hundred by five hundred feet. The height is ninety
feet. On one end above mid-height is a terrace platform
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_767">767</a></span>
one hundred and sixty by three hundred and
fifty feet, and the summit area is two hundred by four
hundred and fifty feet, or nearly two acres, the base
covering over eight acres. On the top a small conical
mound was found, with some human bones, a
deposit of doubtful antiquity. A mound is described
at Lovedale, Kentucky, as being of octagonal base,
five feet high, with sides of a hundred and fifty feet,
three graded ascents, and two conical mounds on its
summit. Mr Jones states that parapet embankments,
round the edge of the summit, sometimes
occur on the southern temple-mounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i767"></a>
<img src="images/i767.jpg" width="347" height="291" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Temple-Mound&mdash;Marietta, Ohio.</p>
</div>

<p>At Marietta, Ohio, are four mounds like that
shown in the cut, within a square enclosure. The
height of this one is ten feet. The mound at Seltzerton,
Mississippi, forty feet in height, covers nearly
six acres, and has a summit area of four acres, on
which are two conical mounds, also forty feet high
and thirty feet in diameter. The base is surrounded
with a ditch ten feet deep, an unusual feature. There
are said to be large adobe blocks in the northern
slope of this pyramid, and the same material is
reported in other southern structures. These reports
require additional confirmation.</p>

<p>The Messier Mound, in Early County, Georgia,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_768">768</a></span>
differs in its location from most temple-mounds,
standing on the summit of a natural hill which overlooks
a broad extent of country. The artificial height
is fifty-five feet, and the summit area sixty-six by
one hundred and fifty-six feet. There are no traces
of any means of ascent, and the slopes are very steep.
A ditch extends in a semicircle from corner to corner
at the southern end, and thence down the slope of
the hill. An excavation of two acres, twenty-five
feet deep on an average, seems to have furnished
the earth for the mound. A round well, sixty feet
in diameter and forty feet deep is found at one end
of the excavation. A temple-mound in the Nacooche
Valley, Georgia, is elliptical in form, and has
a summit area of sixty by ninety feet.</p>

<p>An octagonal mound, forty-five feet high and one
hundred and eighty feet in diameter at the top, is
located on a hill-top opposite the city of Macon; it
was formed of earth carried from the valley below.
A temple-mound at Mason's Plantation, on the
Savannah River, has been partly washed away by the
water, which reveals along the natural surface of the
ground a stratum a foot thick of charcoal, baked earth,
ashes, broken pottery, shells, and bones of animals and
birds, with a few human bones. The mound, which
is of the surrounding alluvial soil, would seem to have
been erected over a spot long occupied as an encampment.
This mound, and another near it, were originally
enclosed by a moat which communicated with
the river, and widened on one side into a broad lagoon.</p>

<p>On Plunkett Creek, Georgia, is a mound of stones
which has the appearance of a temple-mound, having
a summit area forty feet in diameter. Stone is
rarely used in structures of this class; perhaps this
was originally a conical mound. There seem to be few
large mounds in the south unaccompanied by ditches,
which seem here to have been introduced where embankments
would have been preferred in the north.</p>

<p>In a late number of the <i>Cincinnati Quarterly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_769">769</a></span>
Journal of Science</i> I find described, unfortunately
only on newspaper authority, a remarkable temple-mound,
near Springfield, Missouri, on a hill three
hundred feet high. It is of earth and stones, sixty
two feet high, five hundred feet in diameter at the
base and one hundred and thirty at the summit. A
ditch, two hundred feet wide and five feet deep, surrounds
the base, and is crossed by a causeway, opposite
which a stairway of roughly hewn stones leads
up the northern slope. The top is covered by a
platform of stone, in the centre of which lies a stone
ten by twelve feet, and eleven inches thick, hollowed
in the middle. This report without further confirmation
must be considered a hoax&mdash;at least so far as the
stone steps, pavement, and altar are concerned.</p>

<p class="caption">Mississippi Temple-Mounds.</p>
</div>

<p>The group of temple-mounds shown in the cut is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_770">770</a></span>
in Washington County, Mississippi. Others similar
in many respects to these are found at Madison,
Louisiana.</p>

<p>Temple-mounds are homogeneous and never stratified
in their construction, and contain no relics; that
is, the object in their erection was simply to afford a
raised platform, with convenient means of ascent.</p>

<p class="p2">Animal-mounds, the second class, are those that
assume in their ground plan various irregular forms,
sometimes those of living creatures, including quadrupeds,
birds, reptiles, fishes, and in a few cases men.
Mounds of this class are very numerous in the north-west,
particularly in Wisconsin, and rarely occur
further south, although there are a few excellent
specimens in Ohio. They are most abundant in fertile
valleys and rarely occur on the lake shore. Nine
tenths of them are simple straight, curved, or crooked
embankments of irregular form, slightly raised above
the surface, bearing no likeness to any natural object.
In many, fancied to be like certain animals, the resemblance
is imaginary. Those shaped like a tapering
club, with two knobs on one side near the larger
end&mdash;a very common figure&mdash;are called 'lizard-mounds;'
add two other protuberances on the opposite
side and we have the 'turtle-mounds.' Yet a
few bear a clear resemblance to quadrupeds, birds,
and serpents, and all evidently belong to the same
class and were connected with the religious ideas of
the builders. They are not burial mounds, contain no
relics, are but a few feet at the most above the ground,
and are always composed of whitish clay, or the subsoil
of the country. Their dimensions on the ground
are considerable; rude effigies of human form are in
some cases over one hundred feet long; quadrupeds
have bodies and tails each from fifty to two hundred
feet long; birds have wings of a hundred feet; 'lizard-mounds'
are two and even four hundred feet in
length; straight and curved lines of embankment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_771">771</a></span>
reach over a thousand feet; and serpents are equally
extensive. They are grouped without any apparent
order together with conical mounds, occasional embankments,
and few enclosures. They often form a
line extending over a large tract. In some cases the
animal form is an excavation instead of a mound, the
earth being thrown up on the banks. An embankment
in Adams County, Ohio, on the summit of a
hill much like those often occupied by fortifications, is
thought to resemble a monster serpent with curved
body and coiled tail, five feet high, thirty feet wide in
the middle, and over one thousand feet long if uncoiled.
The jaws are wide open and apparently in
the act of swallowing an oval mound measuring one
hundred and sixty by eighty feet. On a hill overlooking
Granville, Ohio, is a mound six feet high and
a hundred and fifty feet long, thought to resemble the
form of an alligator. Stones are rarely used with
the earth in the construction of animal-mounds, and
only in a few cases has the presence of ashes or other
traces of fire been reported.</p>

<p class="p2">The third class of tumuli includes the conical
mounds, mere heaps of earth and stones, so far as outward
appearance is concerned, generally round, often
oval, sometimes square with rounded corners, or even
hexagonal and triangular, in their base-forms, and
varying in height from a few inches to seventy feet,
in diameter from three or four to three hundred feet.
A height of from six to thirty feet and a diameter of
forty to one hundred feet would probably include a
larger part of them. Of course the height has been
reduced and the base increased by the action of rains
more or less in different localities according to the
material employed. Mounds of this class never have
summit platforms or any means of ascent. They are
here as elsewhere in America much more numerous
than other mounds. Although so like one to another
in form, they differ widely in location and contents.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_772">772</a></span>
They are found on hill-tops and in the level plain. In
the former case they are either isolated, grouped
round fortifications, or extend in long lines at irregular
intervals for many miles, suggesting boundary
lines or fire signals. In the valleys they stand alone,
in groups, or in connection with sacred enclosures.
The groups are sometimes symmetrical, as when a
number of mounds are regularly arranged about a
larger central one, or are so placed as to form squares,
circles, and other regular figures; but often no systematic
plan is observable. Also in connection with
the enclosures part of them are symmetrically located
with respect to entrances, angles, or temple-mounds;
while others are scattered apparently without fixed
order. There are few enclosures that do not have a
mound opposite each entrance on the inside. A complete
survey and restoration would probably show
many mounds to belong to some regular system, that
now appear isolated.</p>

<p>The material of the mounds requires no remark
in addition to what has been said of other works. A
large majority are simply heaps of the earth nearest
at hand. Stone mounds, or those of mixed materials,
are rare, and are chiefly confined to the hill-top structures.
Most of the earth mounds are homogeneous
in structure, but some are regularly and doubtless
intentionally stratified. Some of them in the gulf
states are composed of shells, in addition to the shell-mounds
proper formed by the gradual deposit of refuse
shells, the contents of which served as food.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CONTENTS OF THE MOUNDS.</p>

<p class="p2">The contents of the mounds should be divided into
two great classes; those deposited by the Mound-builders,
and those of modern Indian or European
origin. The distinction is important, but difficult;
and in this difficulty is to be found the origin of
many of the extraordinary reports and theories. The
Indians have always felt a kind of veneration for the
mounds as for something of mysterious origin and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_773">773</a></span>
purpose, and have used them as burial places. The
Indian habit of burying with their dead such articles
as were prized by them when living, is well known; as
is also the value attached by them to trinkets obtained
by purchase or theft from Europeans. Consequently
articles of European manufacture, such as
must have been obtained long before the country was
to any great extent occupied by the whites, are often
dug from the mounds and found elsewhere. The discovery
of silver crosses, gun-barrels, and French dials,
does not, however, as Mr Squier remarks, justify the
conclusion that the Mound-builders "were Catholics,
used fire-arms, or spoke French." The mounds are
usually opened by injudicious explorers or by treasure-seekers,
who have paid little attention to the
location of the relics found or the condition of the
surrounding soil. Museums and private collections
are full of spurious relics thus obtained. It is certain
in some cases, and probable in many more, that
the mounds have been 'salted' with specimens with a
view to their early investigation. Yet many mounds
have been opened by scientific men, who have brought
to light curious relics, surely the work of the Mound-builders.
Such relics are found in the centre of the
mounds, on or near the original surface of the ground,
with the surrounding material undisturbed. In the
stratified mounds any disturbance in the soil is easily
detected, but with difficulty in the others. Reports
of unusual relics should be regarded as not authentic
unless accompanied by most positive proof.</p>

<p class="p2">Neither the embankments of sacred enclosures, the
temple-mounds, nor the animal-mounds, have been
proved to contain any relics that may be attributed
to the original builders. Many of the conical mounds
do contain such relics, and by their contents or the
lack of them, are divided into altar-mounds, burial
mounds, and anomalous mounds.</p>

<p>Altar-mounds are always found within or near
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_774">774</a></span>
enclosures, and each one is found to contain something
like an altar, made of burned clay or stone.
The altars are generally of fine clay brought from
some distance, burned hard sometimes to a depth of
twenty inches. They were not burned before being
put in place, but by the action of fires built upon or
round them. Such as were very slightly burned
had no relics. The stone altars are very rare, and
are formed of rough slabs, and not hewn from a
single block. They are square, rectangular, round,
and oval; vary in size from two feet in diameter to
fifteen by fifty feet, but are generally from five to
eight feet; are rarely over twenty inches high; rest
on or near the surface of the ground, in the centre of
the mound; and have a basin-shaped concavity on
the top. The basin is almost always filled with
ashes, in which are the relics deposited by the Mound-builders.
Relics are much more numerous in the
altar than in the burial mounds, but as they are of
the same class, both may best be spoken of together.
These altars are probably the structures spoken of by
early explorers and writers as hearths; there are
reports that some of them were made of burnt bricks.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the altar-mounds is that they are
formed of regular strata of earth, gravel, sand, clay,
etc., which are not horizontal, but follow the curve of
the surface. The outer layer is commonly of gravel.
This stratification renders it easy to detect any modern
disturbance of the mounds, and makes the altar
relics especially interesting and valuable for scientific
purposes. Over the ashes in one altar-mound, were
found plates of mica and some human bones. Skeletons
are often found near the surface of these mounds,
the strata above them being disturbed; in one case
the Indians had penetrated to the centre and deposited
a body on the altar itself. Sir John Lubbock
inclines to the opinion that these were really sepulchral
rather than sacrificial mounds, although he had
not personally examined them. Whatever their use,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_775">775</a></span>
they certainly constitute a clearly defined class distinct
from all others, and the name altar-mounds is
as appropriate as any other.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">BURIAL MOUNDS.</p>

<p class="p2">Unstratified mounds, never within enclosures and
generally at some little distance from them, containing
human remains in their centres and undoubtedly
erected as places of sepulture, constitute the second
class, and are called burial mounds. The custom of
heaping up a mound over the dead was probably imitated
for a long time by the tribes that followed the
Mound-builders, so that the relics from these mounds
are less satisfactory than those found on the altars.
In the burial mounds that may be most confidently
ascribed to the Mound-builders, the human remains
are found in a situation corresponding to that of the
altars. They are usually enclosed in a frame-work of
logs, a covering of bark or coarse matting, or a combination
of these, which have left only faint traces.
Of the skeleton only small fragments remain, which
crumble on exposure to the air. In some cases there
are indications that the body was burned before burial.
Each mound contains, as a rule, a single skeleton,
generally but not always placed east and west. Where
several skeletons are found together, they are sometimes
placed in a circle with the heads towards the
centre. The mounds never contain large numbers of
skeletons, and cannot be regarded as cemeteries, but
only as monuments reared over the remains of personages
high in rank. Very few skulls or bones are
recovered sufficiently entire to give any idea of the
Mound-builders' physique, and these few show no
clearly defined differences from the modern Indian
tribes. Four or five burial mounds are often found in
a group, the smaller ones in such cases being grouped
round a larger central one, generally in contact with
its base. Mr Lapham sketched mounds in Wisconsin
where the body is deposited in a central basin-shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_776">776</a></span>
excavation in the ground very much like those
in Vancouver Island already described.</p>

<p>Of the eastern burial deposits not connected with
the mounds I shall say very little. It has already
been stated that the mounds were in no sense cemeteries.
Only a favored few of what must have been
a dense population were honored by these sepulchral
monuments. Obliged to seek elsewhere the general
depositories of the dead, we find them of various
classes in large numbers; but as yet very little has
been done towards identifying any of them as the
resting-places of the Mound-builders. There are
many bone-pits, or trenches filled with human bones,
in the mound region; but some of the modern Indians
are well known to have periodically collected
and deposited in pits the bones of their dead. Large
numbers of bodies have been found in the caves of
Kentucky and Tennessee, well preserved by the natural
deposits of saltpetre, and wrapped in skins, bark,
or feather-cloth; but the fact that such cloths were
made and used by the southern tribes, renders the
origin of these bodies uncertain. Besides the caves
and trenches there are regular cemeteries, some of
them very extensive. Seven of these are reported
about Nashville, Tennessee, within a radius of ten
miles, each being about a mile in extent. The graves
are of flat stones, lie in ranges, and contain skeletons
much decayed, with some relics. The coffins, or
graves, vary from two to six feet in length, and the
smallest have sometimes been mentioned as indicating
a race of pigmies; it is evident, however, that in such
graves bones were not deposited until the flesh had
been removed. Sometimes there are traces of wooden
coffins, in other cases there are only stones at the head
and feet, and often there is no trace of any coffin. A
few graves contain relics similar to those in the altar-mounds,
and were covered with large forest trees
when first seen by Europeans. Yet the comparatively
well-preserved skeletons, and the presence in many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_777">777</a></span>
cases of iron and relics clearly modern, render it well-nigh
impossible to decide which, if any, of these cemeteries
contain the remains of the Mound-builders.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ANOMALOUS MOUNDS.</p>

<p>Mounds of the third class are called anomalous,
and include all that are not evidently either altar or
burial mounds, or which have some of the peculiarities
of both classes; for instance, in an elliptical
mound an altar was found in one centre, and a skeleton
in the other. Most prominent among them are
the hill-top heaps of earth, or&mdash;oftener than in the
plains below&mdash;of stone. These have as a rule few
original burial deposits, and no relics; are often near
fortifications; and in many cases bear the marks of
fire. Their use cannot be accurately determined, but
they are generally regarded as watch-towers and fire
signal stations. Of course, comparatively few of the
whole number of conical mounds have been explored,
but so far as examined they seem to be about equally
divided between the three classes. The mound
shown in the cut is at Miamisburg, Ohio, and its class
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_778">778</a></span>
is not stated. It is sixty-eight feet high and eight
hundred and fifty feet in circumference. Shell-mounds
abounding in relics of aboriginal work are
very numerous in the gulf states.</p>

<p class="p2">I shall pass briefly over the minor relics of aboriginal
art since it is impossible in this volume to
present illustrative cuts of the thousands of objects
that have been found, or even of typical specimens.
Such relics as are incontestably the work of the
Mound-builders include articles of metal, stone,
earthen ware, bone, and shell. They include implements
and ornaments, besides which many are of
unknown use. Most of the smaller specimens, whose
use is unknown, are called by Mr Dickeson and
others aboriginal coins; perhaps some of them did
serve such a purpose.</p>

<p>The only metals found in the mounds are copper
and silver, the latter only in very small quantities.
A few gold trinkets have been reported, but the evidence
is not conclusive that such were deposited by
the Mound-builders. Iron ore and galena occur, but
no iron or lead.</p>

<p>Copper is found in native masses, and also hammered
into implements and ornaments. There is no
evidence that this metal was ever obtained from ore
by smelting; it was all doubtless worked cold from
native masses by hammering. Concerning the locality
where it was procured, there is little or no
uncertainty. The abundant deposits of native copper
about Lake Superior naturally suggest that
region as the source of the copper supply; the discovery
of anciently worked mines strengthens the
supposition; and the finding among the mounds of
copper mixed with silver in a manner only found at
Lake Superior, makes the matter a certainty. The
modern tribes also obtained some copper from the
same localities. The Mound-builders were ignorant
of the arts of casting, welding, and alloying. They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_779">779</a></span>
had no means of hardening their copper tools, being
in this respect less advanced than the Nahuas and
Mayas. In fact copper implements are much more
rare than ornaments of the same metal. The implements
include axes, hatchets, adzes, knives, spear-heads,
chisels, drills, etc. Ornaments are in the form
of rings, gorgets, medals, bracelets, and beads, with a
large variety of small articles of unknown use, some
of them probably used as money. Very small
models of larger implements like axes are often
found, and were doubtless worn as ornaments.</p>

<p>Silver is of much rarer occurrence than copper, was
obtained probably from the same region, and is almost
invariably found in the form of sheets hammered out
very thin and closely wrapped about small ornaments
of copper or shell. So nicely is the wrapping done
that it often resembles plating. The gold whose discovery
has been reported has been in the form of
beads and so-called coins. Mr Dickeson speaks confidently
of gold, silver, copper, and galena money left
by the Mound-builders. There is no evidence that
the use of iron was known, except the extreme difficulty
of clearing forests and carving stone with implements
of stone and soft copper.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ABORIGINAL POTTERY.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i780"></a>
<img src="images/i780.jpg" width="550" height="278" alt="" />
<p class="caption p2">Earthen Vases from the Mounds.</p>
</div>

<p>Specimens of aboriginal pottery are very abundant,
although much less so within the mounds than elsewhere
near the surface. Mr Squier says, "various
though not abundant specimens of their skill have
been recorded, which in elegance of model, delicacy,
and finish, as also in fineness of material, come fully
up to the best Peruvian specimens, to which they
bear, in many respects, a close resemblance. They
far exceed anything of which the existing tribes of
Indians are known to have been capable." The specimens
in the mound-deposits are, with very few exceptions,
broken. The material is usually a pure
clay, sometimes with a slight admixture of pulverized
quartz or colored flakes of mica, but such admixtures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_780">780</a></span>
are much rarer than in modern specimens. Notwithstanding
their great regularity of form and beauty of
finish, none bear signs that the potter's wheel was
used in their construction, and no vessels are glazed
by vitrification. They are decorated with various
graceful figures, including those of living animals, cut
in with sharp instruments. A few crucibles, capable
of withstanding intense heat, have been found,
also terra-cotta images of animals and men, and ornaments
or coins in small quantities. Pottery-kilns
are found in the south, but that they were the work
of the Mound-builders has not been satisfactorily
proven. Specimens of the finer class of vases are
shown in the cut. The first is of pure clay with a
slight silicious mixture. It is five and a half inches
high and six and a half in diameter, not over one
sixth of an inch in uniform thickness, pierced with
four holes in the line round the rim, dark brown or
umber in color, and highly polished. The decorative
lines are cut in with a sharp instrument which left no
ragged edges. The second vase is of somewhat
smaller size and coarser material; but more elaborately
ornamented and only one eighth of an inch in thickness.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_781">781</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">STONE IMPLEMENTS.</p>

<p>Stone implements are more abundant than those
of any other material in the altar-mounds and elsewhere.
They include arrow and spear heads, knives,
axes, hatchets, chisels, and other variously formed cutting
instruments, with hammers and pestles. These
are made of quartz and other hard varieties of stone,
all belonging to the mound region except the obsidian.
There is no doubt that obsidian implements
were used by the Mound-builders, and as this material
is said not to be found nearer than Mexico and
California, it is perhaps as likely that the implements
were obtained by trade as that they were
manufactured in the country. Neither the obsidian
knives, nor other stone weapons, show any marked
differences from those found in Mexico, Central
America, and most other parts of the world. Lance
and arrow heads, finished and in the rough, entire or
more frequently broken by the action of fire, are
taken by hundreds and thousands from the altar-mounds;
several bushels of lance-heads of milky
quartz were found in one mound. It is a remarkable
fact, however, that no weapons whatever are found
in burial mounds. Beads, rings, and other ornaments
of stone are often found, with a variety of
anomalous articles whose use is more or less imperfectly
understood. Besides weapons and knives,
pipes are the articles most abundant, and on which
the Mound-builders expended most lavishly their
skill, carving the bowls into a great variety of beautiful
forms, at what must have been an immense
outlay of labor. A remarkable peculiarity of their
pipe-carvings is that accurate representations are
given of different natural objects instead of the rude
caricatures and monstrosities in which savage art
usually delights. Nearly every beast, bird, and reptile
indigenous to the country is truthfully represented,
together with some creatures now only found
in tropical climates, such as the lamantin and toucan.
The pipes generally consist of a bowl rising from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_782">782</a></span>
centre of the convex side of a curved base, one end
of which serves as a handle and the other is pierced
for a stem. They are always cut from a single piece,
the material being generally a hard porphyry, oftenest
red, and strongly resembling in some cases the
red pipe-stone of the Coteau des Prairies. The locality
where this pipe material was obtained is unknown.
Many of the sculptured figures show skillful
workmanship and a high polish; I think that many
of them are not inferior to the products of Nahua
and Maya skill. Some rude stone images of unknown
use have been found at various points, but I
am not aware that any relics have been authentically
reported from the altar-mounds which indicate that
the ancient people were worshipers of idols. Mica is
the mineral most common in both altar and burial
mounds, where it occurs in plates cut into a great
variety of forms. Some of them have been conjectured
to have served as mirrors. Bushels are
sometimes deposited in a single mound. Pieces of
coal artificially formed are included by Dickeson
among his aboriginal coins.</p>

<p class="p2">Bones of indigenous animals are found worked
into daggers, awls, and similar implements; or as
ornaments in the form of beads. Similar use was
made of the teeth and talons of beasts and birds.
Teeth of the bear, wolf, panther, alligator, and shark,
have been found, some of the latter being fossils,
together with large quantities of teeth resembling
those of the whale, but not fully identified.</p>

<p>Five varieties of marine shells, all from the gulf
shores, have been examined, with pearls whose size
and numbers prove that they are not of fresh-water
origin. Both are used for ornaments, chiefly in the
form of beads. Pearls are also found in a few instances
serving as eyes for animal and bird sculptures.
Some articles of bone and shell have been mistaken
for ivory and accredited with an Asiatic origin,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_783">783</a></span>
through ignorance that their material is found on the
shores of the gulf. Many articles found in the
mounds, and not perhaps included in the preceding
general description, are interesting, but could only
be described in a detailed account, for which I have
no space; but most relics not thus included are of
doubtful authenticity, and a doubtful monument of
antiquity should always be attributed to modern
times.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ANCIENT MINES.</p>

<p class="p2">The ancient miners have left numerous traces of
their work in the region of Lake Superior. At one
place a piece of pure copper weighing over five tons
was found fifteen feet below the surface, under trees
at least four hundred years old. It had been raised
on skids, bore marks of fire, and some stone implements
were scattered about. There is no evidence
that the tribes found in possession of the country by
the first French missionaries ever worked these mines,
or had any tradition of a people that had worked
them, although both they and their ancestors had
copper knives hammered from lumps of the metal,
which are very commonly found on the surface. All
the traditions and Indian stories of 'mines' may most
consistently be referred to these natural superficial deposits.
The ancient mines were for the most part in
the same localities where the best modern mines are
worked. Most of them have left as traces only slight
depressions in the surface, the finding of which is
regarded by prospectors as a tolerably sure indication
of a rich vein of copper. The cut represents a section
of one of the veins of copper-bearing rock
worked by the ancient miners. The mass of copper
at <i>a</i> weighed about six tons. At the top a portion of
the stone had been left across the vein as a support.
Copper implements, including wedges used in mining
as 'gads,' are found in and about the old mines; with
hammers of stone, mostly grooved for withe handles.
Some weigh from thirty to forty pounds and have two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_784">784</a></span>
grooves; others again are not grooved at all. In one
case remains of a handle of twisted cedar-roots were
found, and much-worn wooden shovels often occur.
There are no enclosures, mounds, or other traces of a
permanent settlement of the Mound-builders in the
mining region. It is probable that the miners came
each summer from the south; in fact, it would have
been impossible to work the mines in winter by their
methods.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i784"></a>

<p class="caption">Section of an old Copper Mine.</p>
</div>

<p class="sidenote p2">ROCK-INSCRIPTIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">Nearly all the coins, medals, stone tablets, etc., that
have been discovered within the region occupied by
the Mound-builders, bearing inscriptions in regular
apparently alphabetic characters, may be proved to be
of European origin; and the few specimens that do
not admit of such proof should of course be attributed
to such an origin in the absence of conclusive evidence
to the contrary. Rude delineations of men, animals,
and other recognizable objects, together with many
arbitrary, perhaps conventional, characters, are of frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_785">785</a></span>
occurrence on the walls of caves, on perpendicular
river-cliffs, and on detached stones. They are
sometimes incised, but usually painted. Most bear a
strong resemblance to the artistic efforts of modern
tribes; and those which seem to bear marks of a
greater antiquity, have by no means been identified
as the work of the Mound-builders. These eastern
rock-inscriptions do not call for additional remarks,
after what has been said of similar carvings in other
regions. Many of the figures have a meaning to
those who make them, but that meaning, as in all
writings of this class, perishes with the artist and his
immediate times. Attempts by zealous antiquaries
to penetrate the signification of particular inscriptions&mdash;as
that on Dighton Rock, Massachusetts, and other
well-known examples&mdash;have failed to convince any
but the determined advocate of such theories as seem
to derive support from the so-called translation. My
father saw a stone tablet taken from a stone mound
near Newark, covered with carved characters, which
the clergyman of the town pronounced to be the ten
commandments in ancient Hebrew. I have no doubt
that the figures did closely resemble the ancient Hebrew
in one respect at least&mdash;that is, in being equally
unfamiliar to the clergyman.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">Without taking up here the various theories respecting
the origin, history, and disappearance of the
Mound-builders, it may be well to express in a few
brief conclusions what may be learned of this people
by an examination of the monuments which they
have left.</p>

<p>They were a numerous people, as is sufficiently
proved by the magnitude and geographical extent of
their works. They were probably <i>one</i> people, that is,
composed of tribes living under similar laws, religion,
and other institutions. Such variations as are observed
in the monuments are only those that would
naturally occur between central and frontier regions,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_786">786</a></span>
although the animals-mounds of the north-west
present some difficulties. The Mound-builders were
an agricultural people. Tribes that live by hunting
never build extensive public works, neither would
the chase support a sufficiently large population for
the erection of such works. Moreover, the location
of the monuments in the most fertile sections goes
far to confirm this conclusion. Some of the larger
enclosures have been supposed,&mdash;only by reason of
their size, however,&mdash;to have been cultivated fields;
and evident traces of an ancient cultivation are found,
although not clearly referable to the Mound-builders.</p>

<p>There is nothing to show an advanced civilization
in the modern sense of the word, but they were civilized
in comparison with the roving hunter-tribes of
later times. They knew nothing of the use of metals
beyond the mere hammering of native masses of
copper and silver; they built no stone structures;
they had seemingly made no approach to the higher
grades of hieroglyphic writing. Their civilization as
recorded by its material relics consisted of a knowledge
of agriculture; considerable skill in the art of
fortification; much greater skill than that of the
Indians in the manufacture of pottery and the carving
of stone pipes; the mathematical knowledge displayed
in the laying-out of perfect circles and accurate
angles, and in the correspondence in size
between different works. Their earth-works show
more perseverance than skill; no one of them necessarily
implies the use of mechanical aids to labor;
there is none that a large number of men might not
construct by carrying earth in simple baskets.</p>

<p>All traces of their architecture have disappeared.
It has been suggested that were the temples yet
standing on their pyramidal foundations, they might
compare favorably with those of Central America
and Mexico. But the construction of wooden edifices
with any pretensions to grandeur and symmetry, by
means of stone and soft copper tools, seems absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_787">787</a></span>
impossible; at least such structures would
require infinitely greater skill than that displayed by
the Nahuas and Mayas, and it is more reasonable to
suppose that the temples of the Mound-builders were
rude wooden buildings.</p>

<p>The monuments imply a wide-spread religious system
under a powerful priesthood; private devotion
manifests itself on a scale less magnificent, and one
involving less hard work. Of their rites we know
nothing. The altar-mounds suggest sacrifice; burned
human bones, human sacrifice. Gateways on the
east, and the east and west direction of embankments
and skeletons may connect worship with the sun; but
all is conjecture. No idols, known to be such, have
been found; the cemeteries, if any of them belong to
the Mound-builders, show no uniform usage in burial.
The ancient people lived under a system of government
considerably advanced, more than likely in the
hands of the priesthood, but of its details we know
nothing. A social condition involving some form of
slavery would be most favorable for the construction
of such works.</p>

<p>The monuments described are not the work of the
Indian tribes found in the country, nor of any tribes
resembling them in institutions. Those tribes had no
definite tradition even of past contact with a superior
people, and it is only in the south among the little-known
Natchez, that slight traces of a descent from,
or imitation of, the Mound-builders appear. Most
and the best authorities deem it impossible that the
Mound-builders were even the remote ancestors of the
Indian tribes; and while inclined to be less positive
than most who have written on the subject respecting
the possible changes that may have been effected by
a long course of centuries, I think that the evidence
of a race locally extinct is much stronger here than
in any other part of the continent.</p>

<p>The monuments are not sufficient in themselves to
absolutely prove or disprove the truth of any one of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_788">788</a></span>
the following theories: 1st. An indigenous culture
springing up among the Mississippi tribes, founded
on agriculture, fostered by climate and other unknown
circumstances, constantly growing through long ages,
driving back the surrounding walls of savagism, but
afterwards weakened by unknown causes, yielding
gradually to savage hordes, and finally annihilated or
driven in remnants from their homes southward. 2d.
A colony from the southern peoples already started in
the path of civilization, growing as before in power,
but at last forced to yield their homes into the possession
of savages. 3d. A migrating colony from the
north, dwelling long in the land, gradually increasing
in power and culture, constantly extending their dominion
southward, and finally abandoning voluntarily
or against their will, the north for the more favored
south, where they modified or originated the southern
civilization.</p>

<p>The last theory, long a very popular one, is in itself
less consistent and receives less support from the
relics than the others. The second, which has some
points in common with the first, is most reasonable
and best supported by monumental and traditional
evidence. The temple-mounds strongly resemble in
their principal features the southern pyramids; at
least they imply a likeness of religious ideas in the
builders. The use of obsidian implements shows a
connection, either through origin, war, or commerce,
with the Mexican nations, or at least with nations
who came in contact with the Nahuas. There are,
moreover, several Nahua traditions respecting the
arrival on their coasts from the north-east, of civilized
strangers. There is very little evidence that the
Mound-builders introduced in the south the Nahua
civilization, and none whatever that the Aztec migration
started from the Mississippi Valley, but I am
inclined to believe that there was actually a connection
between the two peoples; that the Mound-builders,
or those that introduced their culture, were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_789">789</a></span>
originally a Nahua colony, and that these people may
be referred to in some of the traditions mentioned.
Without claiming to be able to determine exactly the
relation between the Mound-builders and Nahuas,
I shall have something further to say on this subject
in another volume.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ANTIQUITY OF THE MONUMENTS.</p>

<p>The works were not built by a migrating people,
but by a race that lived long in the land. It seems
unlikely that the results attained could have been
accomplished in less than four or five centuries. Nothing
indicates that the time did not extend to thousands
of years, but it is only respecting the minimum
time that there can be any grounds for reasonable
conjecture. If we suppose the civilization indigenous,
of course a much longer period must be assigned to
its development than if it was introduced by a migration&mdash;or
rather a colonization, for civilized and semi-civilized
peoples do not migrate en masse. Moreover a
northern origin would imply a longer duration of time
than one from the south, where a degree of civilization
is known to have existed.</p>

<p>How long a time has elapsed since the Mound-builders
abandoned their works? Here again a minimum
estimate only can be sought. No work is more
enduring than an embankment of earth. There is no
positive internal proof that they were not standing
one, five, or ten thousand years ago. The evidences
of an ancient abandonment of the works, or serious
decline of the builders' power, are as follows:&mdash;1st,
the fact that none of them stand on the last-formed
terrace of the rivers, most on the oldest terrace, and
that those on the second bear in some cases marks of
having been invaded by water. The rate of terrace-forming
varies on different streams, and there are no
sufficient data for estimating in years the time required
for the formation of any one of the terraces,
at least scientific men are careful not to give a definite
opinion in the matter; but it is evident that each
required a very long period, and the last one a much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_790">790</a></span>
longer time than any of the others, on account of the
gradual longitudinal leveling of the river-beds. 2d.
The complete disappearance of all wooden structures,
which must have been of great solidity. 3d. The
advanced state of decomposition of human bones in a
soil well calculated for their preservation. Skeletons
are found in Europe well preserved at a known age
of eighteen hundred years. 4th. The absence of the
Mound-builders from the traditions of modern tribes.
Nothing would seem more likely to be preserved in
mythic or historic traditions than contact with a
superior people, and the mounds would serve to keep
the traditions alive. 5th. The fact that the monuments
were covered in the seventeenth century with
primitive forests, uniform with those which covered
the other parts of the country. In this latitude the
age of a forest tree may be much more accurately
determined than in tropical climates; and trees from
four to five hundred years old have been examined in
many well-authenticated cases over mounds and embankments.
Equally large trees in all stages of
decomposition were found at their feet on and under
the ground, so that the abandonment of the works
must be dated back at least twice the actual age of
the standing trees. It is a fact well known to
woodsmen that when cultivated land is abandoned
the first growth is very unlike the original forest,
both in the species and size of the trees, and that
several generations would be required to restore the
primitive timber. Consequently a thousand years
must have passed since some of the works were
abandoned. The monuments of the Mississippi present
stronger internal evidence of great antiquity
than any others in America, although it by no means
follows that they are older than Palenque and Copan.
The height of the Mound-builders' power should not,
without very positive external evidence, be placed at
a later date than the fifth or sixth century of our era.

<p>I conclude with a short chapter on Peruvian antiquities,
made up for the most part from the work of
Rivero and Tschudi, and illustrated with the cuts
copied from that work for Mr Baldwin's account.<a id="FNanchor_XIV-1" href="#Footnote_XIV-1" class="fnanchor">[XIV-1]</a>
Ancient Peru included also modern Ecuador, Bolivia,
and a large part of Chili; and the most remarkable
monuments of antiquity are considered the works of a
people preceding that found by Pizarro in possession
of the country, and bearing very much the same relation
to the subjects of the Incas as the ancient Mayas
bore to the Quichés of Guatemala, or perhaps the
Toltecs to the Aztecs. The Peruvians that came into
contact with the Spaniards were superior in some respects
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_792">792</a></span>
to the Aztecs. At least equally advanced in
the various mechanical and fine arts, except sculpture
and architectural decoration, they lived under as perfect
a system of government, and rendered homage to
less bloodthirsty gods. They kept their records by
means of <i>quipus</i>, or knotted strings, a method probably
as useful practically as the Aztec picture-writing,
but not so near an approach to an alphabet; while the
more ancient nations have left nothing to compare
with the hieroglyphic tablets of Central America, and
the evidence is far from satisfactory that they possessed
any advanced art in writing. It will be seen
from the specimens to be presented that their architecture,
though perhaps more massive than that of
Mayas or Nahuas, is not on the whole of a superior
character. The most marked contrasts are found in
the occurrence in Peru of cyclopean structures, the
use of larger blocks of stone, the comparative absence
of the pyramidal foundations, of architectural and
hieroglyphic sculpture, and the more extensive use of
adobes as a building-material.</p>

holy structure, but is usually applied to the conical
mounds of the country, mostly mounds of sepulture.
Thousands of these have been opened and from them
have been taken a great variety of relics, together
with preserved mummies wrapped in native cloth.
The relics include implements and ornaments of
metal, stone, bone, shell, and wood. The Peruvians
seem to have had a more abundant supply of metals
than the civilized nations of North America, and to
have been at least equally skillful in working them.
The cuts show specimens of copper cutting implements,
of which a great variety are found. Besides
copper, they had gold and silver in much greater
abundance than the northern artisans, and the arts
of melting, casting, soldering, beating, inlaying, and
carving these metals, were carried to a high degree of
perfection. Every one has read the marvelous accounts,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_793">793</a></span>
naturally exaggerated, but still with much
foundation in truth, of the immense quantities of
gold obtained by the Spaniards in Peru; of the room
filled with golden utensils by the natives as a ransom
for the Inca Atahuallpa. A golden vase is shown in
the cut. Large quantities of gold have been taken
in more modern times from the huacas, where it was
doubtless placed in many cases to keep it from the
hands of the conquerors. Most of the articles have
of course gone to the melting-pot, but sufficient specimens
have been preserved or sketched to show the
degree of excellence to which the Peruvian smiths
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_794">794</a></span>
had attained. The following cut shows a silver vase.
The search for treasure in the huacas still goes on,
and is not always unrewarded. Tin, lead, and quicksilver
are said to have been worked by the natives.
Iron ore is very abundant in Peru, but the only evidence
that iron was used is the difficulty of executing
the native works of excavation and cutting stone
without it, and the fact that the metal had a name in
the native language. No traces of it have ever been
found. The cut shows two copper tweezers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ABORIGINAL ROADS.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable Peruvian remains are
the paved roads which crossed the country in every
direction, especially from north to south. Two of
the grandest highways extended from the region
north of Quito southward to Cuzco, and according to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_795">795</a></span>
some authors still farther to Chili. One runs over
the mountains, the other chiefly through the plains.
Their length is at least twelve hundred miles, and
the grading of the mountain road presented, as Mr
Baldwin believes, far greater difficulties than the
Pacific Railroad. These roads are from eighteen to
twenty-six feet wide, protected at the sides by a
thick wall, and paved generally with stone blocks,
but sometimes with a mixture of cement and fine
stone&mdash;an aboriginal infringement on the 'Macadam'
process. The highways followed a straight course,
and turned aside for no obstacle. Ravines and
marshes were filled up with masonry, and the solid
rock of the mountains was cut away for many miles.
But when rivers were encountered, light suspension
bridges seem to have been resorted to instead of
massive stone bridges. It is true that the most
glowing accounts of these roads are found in the
writings of the Conquistadores, and that only ruined
portions now remain; but the reports of Humboldt
and others, respecting the remains, leave little doubt
of their former imposing character.</p>

<p class="caption">Peruvian Pottery.</p>

<p>Articles of pottery, of which three specimens are
shown in the cuts, are at least equal in material and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_796">796</a></span>
finish to those produced by Nahua and Maya potters.
The finest specimens are vases found in sepulchral
deposits, and many utensils designed for more common
use are preserved by the present inhabitants,
and are preferred for their solidity to the work of
modern potters. Small images of human and animal
forms in terra cotta, as in gold and silver, are of even
more frequent occurrence than utensils. There is no
evidence that the images were fashioned with a different
purpose here and in the north; some were simply
ornaments, a few probably portraits, others miniature
deities, deposited from superstitious motives with the
dead.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CITY OF THE INCAS.</p>

<p class="p2">About twenty miles south of Lima, in the valley
of Lurin, and overlooking the sea, are the ruins of
Pachacamac, shown in the cut. This was a city of
the Incas, that is, it belonged to the later period of
Peruvian civilization. All the structures were built
of adobes, and are much dilapidated. The Temple
of the Sun stands on a hill six hundred feet high,
the upper portion of which shows traces of having
been divided into terraces over thirty feet high and
five to eight feet wide. The adobe wall which surrounds
the temple is from eight to eleven feet thick,
and is only standing to the height of four to five feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_797">797</a></span>
The ruined structures are very numerous, and on
one of the inner walls some traces of red and yellow
paint are visible.</p>

<p>In the district of Santo Tomas in the north, at
Cuelap, a grand and peculiar ruin is described by Sr
Nieto in an official government report. A mass&mdash;of
earth, probably, although not fully examined in the interior&mdash;is
faced with a solid wall of hewn stone, and is
thirty-six hundred feet long, five hundred and seventy
feet wide, and one hundred and fifty feet in perpendicular
height. On the summit stands another similar
structure six hundred by five hundred feet and
also one hundred and fifty feet high. The lower wall
is pierced with three entrances to an inclined plane
leading in a curved line to the summit, with sentry-boxes
at intervals and on the summit. These passages
are six feet wide at the base but only two at the
top, and those of the second story are similar. In
both stories there are chambers, in the walls of which
and in the outer walls there are small niches containing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_798">798</a></span>
skeletons. Some of the upper chambers are paved
with large flat stones, on each of which lies a skeleton.
The report of this immense structure is probably
founded on fact but greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p class="caption">Decorations at Gran-Chimú.</p>
</div>

<p>The ruins of Gran-Chimú, in the vicinity of
Truxillo, cover an area of three quarters of a league,
and beyond these limits are seven or eight great enclosures
with adobe walls, in some of which are conical
mounds, or huacas, and some traces of buildings.
The two principal structures, called palaces, are surrounded
by walls one hundred and forty feet high,
sixteen feet thick at the base, but tapering to three
or four feet at the top. Round one of the palaces
the wall is double, as shown by the section in the
cut. The English translation of Rivero, instead of
surrounding one of the palaces with a double wall
like the original, represents one wall as being twice
as high and thick as the other. These walls, like all
the structures of Gran-Chimú, are of adobes nine by
eighteen inches, resting on a foundation of rough
stones laid in clay. In connection with the larger
palace is a square containing apartments, the walls of
which are a conglomerate of gravel and clay, smooth,
and whitewashed on the interior. There are also
plazas and streets regularly laid out, and a reservoir
which by a subterranean aqueduct was supplied with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_799">799</a></span>
water from the Rio Moche two miles distant. This
palace&mdash;and by palace, a group of edifices within an
enclosure, rather than a single edifice, seems to be
meant&mdash;has two entrances, one in the middle of each
long side. The second palace is one hundred and twenty
five yards further east, and is also divided by squares
and narrow streets. At one end is the huaca of
Misa, surrounded by a low wall, pierced by galleries
and rooms in which have been found mummies,
cloths, gold and silver, implements, and a wooden
idol with pieces of pearl-shell. All the inner walls
are built of a mass of clay and gravel or of adobes.
The cut shows specimens of the ornamentation, which
seem to bear outwardly a slight resemblance to the
mosaic work of Mitla, although the method of their
construction is not explained. "Outside of these
notable edifices, there is an infinite number of squares
and small houses, some round and others square,
which were certainly dwellings of the lower classes,
and whose great extent indicates that the population
must have been very large." Among the ruins are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_800">800</a></span>
many truncated conical mounds, or huacas, of fine
gravel, from some of which interesting relics and
large quantities of gold have been taken. The so-called
Temple of the Sun is three quarters of a
league east of the city near Moche, in connection
with which are several adobe structures, one of them,
perhaps the temple itself, so far as may be determined
by Rivero's vague account, made worse than
vague in the English translation, is a regular pyramid
of adobes. It is four hundred and fourteen by
four hundred and thirty feet at the base, three hundred
and forty-five feet wide on the summit, and over
eighty feet high, built in terraces, pierced with a
gallery through the centre, and affording a fine view
of the sea and the city of Truxillo.</p>

<p class="caption p2">Ruin at Titicaca.</p>
</div>

<p>The cut represents a ruin on the Island of Titicaca
in the lake of the same name. These island remains
are among the oldest of Peruvian antiquities, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_801">801</a></span>
the structures are built of hewn stone. Respecting
these ruins we only learn from the explorers that
"though not very imposing" they are well preserved,
"with windows and doors, with posts and thresholds
of hewn stone also, these being wider below than
above." Another ruin on the same island is shown
in the cut on the following page.</p>

<p>At Chavin de Huanta the structures are built of
hewn stone very accurately joined without any mortar
in sight on the outside, and a rubble of rough stones
and clay on the inside. In a building spoken of as
a fortress there is a covered way with rooms at its
sides, all covered with sandstone blocks about twelve
feet long. The walls are six feet thick, and in the
interior is the opening to a subterranean passage
which is said to lead under the river to another building.
In the gallery human bones and some relics
were found. The modern town is built mostly over
the ruins of an ancient aqueduct, and a bridge over
the stream is built of three immense stones, each over
twenty feet long, taken from the fort. The ancient
people were especially skillful in the construction of
aqueducts, some of which were reported by the early
writers as several hundred miles in length, and a few
of which of less extent are still in actual use.</p>

<p>The cut represents the Mirador, or look-out, at Huanuco
el Viejo. This structure measures about one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_802"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_803">803</a></span>
hundred by one hundred and sixty feet at the base,
and is about fifteen feet high, in a pyramidal form
without terraces and furnished with a parapet wall
enclosing the summit platform. The foundation is of
rough stones, which form two steps projecting four or
five feet, not clearly indicated in the cut. The walls
or facings are of hewn blocks of limestone about four
feet and a half long by a foot and a half thick. The
blocks are very accurately cut and laid in cement.
The interior is filled with gravel and clay, with a concavity
in the centre popularly supposed to communicate
by means of a subterranean gallery with the
palace some half a mile distant. From a doorway in
the parapet wall on the south an inclined plane&mdash;which
seems often to have taken the place of a stairway
in Peru&mdash;leads down to the ground. On the
wall at each side of the entrance crouches an animal
in stone, so much damaged that its kind cannot be
determined.</p>

<p class="caption">Gateway at Huanuco.</p>

<p>Another noted ruin at Huanuco is that whose entrance
is shown in the cut. The walls are of round
stones irregularly laid in mortar, a kind of rubble
called by the Peruvians <i>pirca</i>, but the gateway,
shown in the cut, is built of hewn blocks three varas&mdash;as
Rivero says, probably meaning feet&mdash;by one and
a half. The lintel is one stone block eleven feet long,
and the inclined posts are said to be of one piece, although
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_804">804</a></span>
the cut indicates that each is composed of
four. The animals sculptured over the gateway at
the sides are called monkeys by Rivero. Within the
structure there are five similar gateways shown in the
preceding cut and in the following ground plan. In
the interior are rooms of cut stone, with niches in the
walls, an aqueduct, and a reservoir. The quarries
that supplied the stone for the Huanuco structures
are still seen about half a mile away. Many traces
of buildings of round stones in clay are found in the
same vicinity.</p>

<p>Near Chupan, a tower is mentioned on the verge
of a precipice overhanging the Rio Marañon. In
the district of Junin there is a line or system of
fortifications on the precipitous cliffs of a ravine, built
mostly of micaceous slate. At Cuzco are some remains
of the city of the Incas, and there is said to
be some evidence that this city was founded on the
ruins of another of an earlier epoch; the latter including
part of the fortification of Ollantaytambo,
built of stones cut in irregular forms, some of them
of great size, and very neatly joined.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_805">805</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">MONUMENTS OF TIAHUANACO.</p>

<p>The ruins at Tiahuanaco, ten or twelve miles from
Lake Titicaca, are considered among the most ancient
in Peru. They include stones from fifteen to twenty
feet high, some cut, others rough, standing in rows.
All the structures were in a very dilapidated condition
when the Spaniards came, and some very large
stone statues in human form were found, with stone
columns. One of the most interesting monuments is
the monolithic doorway shown in the cut. The
opening is seventy-six inches high and thirty-eight
wide. Rivero and Tschudi represent the sculptured
figures in the small squares as being profiles of the
human face instead of those shown in Baldwin's cut.
There were several of these doorways. Several idols
and some very large blocks of cut stone were dug up
in 1846, and the latter used for mill-stones. The
blocks are described as thirty feet long, eighteen feet
wide, and six feet thick, being shaped so as to form a
channel when one was placed upon another.</p>

<p>A building on the Island of Coati, in Lake Titicaca,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_806">806</a></span>
is shown in the cut. Rivero gives a view and
plan of another large palace, consisting for the most
part of a single line of low apartments built round
three sides of a rectangular court, and bearing some
resemblance, as Mr Baldwin remarks, to the Central
American structures, except that it does not rest on a
pyramidal foundation. Rock-inscriptions of the same
rude class so often mentioned in the northern continent,
occur also in Peru, although somewhat less frequently,
so far as may be judged by the reports of
explorers.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p class="p2">The contents of the preceding pages may be sufficient
to show the reader that the resemblance between
the southern and northern monuments, if any
resemblance exists, is very faint. The Maya and
Peruvian peoples may have been one in remote
antiquity; if so, the separation took place at a period
long preceding any to which we are carried by the
material relics of the Votanic empire, and of the
most ancient epoch of the southern civilization, or
even by traditional annals and the vaguest myths.
There seems to be a natural tendency even among
antiquarians to attribute all American civilizations
to a common origin, constantly moving back the date
as investigation progresses. This tendency has much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_807">807</a></span>
in common with that which so persistently traces
American civilization to the old world, old-world
culture to one centre, the human race to one pair,
and the first pair to a special creation, performed
at a definite time and point in Asia. Be the results
of the tendency referred to true or false, it is evident
that superstition has contributed more than science
to the zeal that has supported them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-2" href="#FNanchor_II-2"><span class="label">[II-2]</span></a> I might except a Roman coin of the time of Cæsar Augustus, and a
buried ship, or galley, of antique model, said to have been discovered in early
times by the Spaniards in the vicinity of Panamá, and which figured somewhat
largely in early speculations on the question of American origin. I
need not say that the evidence for the authenticity of such a discovery is
extremely unsatisfactory. See: <i>García</i>, <i>Orígen de los Ind.</i>, p. 174, with

Seemann claims to have been the first to discover stone sculptures near
David in 1848, and he read a paper on them before the Archæological Institute
of London in 1851. He also briefly mentions them in his <i>Voy.
Herald</i>, vol. i., pp. 312-13, for which work drawings were prepared but
not published. Some of the drawings were, however, afterwards printed in
<i>Bollaert's Antiq. Researches in N. Granada</i>, (Lond., 1860,) and a few cuts
of inscribed figures also inserted with farther description by Seemann in
<i>Pim and Seemann's Dottings</i>, pp. 25-32. It is stated in the last-named
work that M. Zeltner, French Consul at Panamá, whose private collection
contained specimens from Chiriquí, published photographs of some of
them with descriptive letter-press. Bollaert also wrote a paper on 'The
Ancient Tombs of Chiriquí,' in <i>Amer. Ethno. Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. ii.,
pp. 151, 159. On various occasions from 1859 to 1865, travelers or residents on
the Isthmus, chiefly parties connected with the Panamá railway, sent specimens,
drawings, and descriptions to New York, where they were presented
to the American Ethnological Society, or exhibited before and discussed by
that body at its monthly meetings, an account of which may be found in
the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vol. iii., p. 240, vol. iv., pp. 47-8, 113, 144, 176-7, 239-41,

Squier resided in Nicaragua as Chargé d'Affaires of the United States
during the year 1849-50. On account of his position he was afforded facilities
for research not enjoyed by other foreigners, and which his well-known
antiquarian tastes and abilities prompted and enabled him to use to the
best advantage during the limited time left from official duties. Besides
the several editions of the work mentioned, Mr Squier's accounts or fragments
thereof have been published in periodicals in different languages;
while other authors have made up almost wholly from his writings their
brief descriptions of Nicaraguan antiquities. See <i>Wappäus</i>, <i>Geog. u.

with the examination of antiquities as his main object. Both works are
illustrated with plates and cuts; and both authors brought away interesting
specimens which were deposited by the American in the Smithsonian
Institution, and by the Englishman in the British Museum. '<span xml:lang="fr">J'avoue

the paintings precisely in the style of the Mexican and Guatemalan
MSS., closely resembling, some of the figures indeed identical with, those
of the Dresden MS. Pim and Seemann, <i>Dottings</i>, p. 401, also noted the
'coiled-up lizard' and other pictures, calling the locality Asososca Lake.

in strength and solidity of construction, and of more modern origin.' <i>Cent.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_III-13" href="#FNanchor_III-13"><span class="label">[III-13]</span></a> The <span xml:lang="es">Licenciado</span> Diego García de Palacio, <span xml:lang="es">Oidor</span> (Justice, not Auditor)
of the <span xml:lang="es">Real Audiencia</span> of Guatemala, in accordance with the duties of his
office, traveled extensively in Guatemala and adjoining provinces, embodying
the results of his observations on countries and peoples visited in a relation
to King Felipe II. of Spain, dated March 8, 1576, which document is
preserved in the celebrated Muñoz collection of MSS. It contains a description
of the ruins of Copan which exists in print as follows; <i>Palacio</i>, <i>Relacion</i>,
in <i>Pacheco</i>, <i>Col. Doc. Inéd.</i>, tom. vi., pp. 37-9; <i>Palacio</i>, <i><span xml:lang="es">Carta dirijida
al Rey</span></i>, Albany, 1860, pp. 88-96, including an English translation by E. G.
Squier; <i>Palacios</i>, <i>Description</i>, in <i>Ternaux-Compans</i>, <i>Recueil de Doc.</i>, pp. 42-4,
which is a somewhat faulty French translation; <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>,
1843, tom. xcvii., pp. 38-40; <i>Squier's Cent. Amer.</i>, pp. 242-4; and it is mentioned
by Señor J. B. Muñoz in a report on American antiquities, written as
early as 1785, of which a translation is given in <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>,
<i>Palenqué</i>, pp. 7-8; Herrera, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, quotes, or rather takes from, Palacio's
relation extensively, but omits the portion touching Copan. This
first account of the ruins is by no means the worst that has been written.
Although naturally incomplete, it is evidently a bona-fide description by an
actual visitor, written at a time when the ruins were very nearly in their
present condition, and their origin wrapped in mystery, although the stirring
events of 1530 were yet comparatively fresh in the memory of the
natives. The next account is that in <i>Fuentes y Guzman</i>, <i><span xml:lang="es">Recopilacion Flórida
de la Historia del Reino de Guatemala</span></i>, <i>MS.</i>, 1689. This work was
never printed, although said to be in preparation for the press in 1856. <i>Ximenez</i>,
<i>Hist. Ind. Guat.</i>, p. vii. Fuentes' description of Copan was, however,
given to the public in 1808, in <i>Juarros</i>, <i>Compendio de la Hist. de la
Ciudad de Guatemala</i>, a work translated into English in 1823, under the
title of <i>A Statistical and Commercial Hist. of the Kingdom of Guatemala</i>.
From Juarros the account is taken by many writers, none, so far as I know,
having quoted Fuentes in the original. Where the latter obtained his information
is not known. His account is brief, and justly termed by Brasseur
de Bourbourg, <i>Palenqué</i>, p. 14., 'la description menteuse de Fuentes,'
since nothing like the relics therein mentioned have been found in
later times. Yet it is possible that the original was mutilated in passing
through Juarros' hands. This description, given in full in my text, is repeated
more or less fully in <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. i., p. 131; <i>Warden</i>,
<i>Recherches</i>, p. 71; <i>Conder's Mex. Guat.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 299-300; <i>Malte-Brun</i>,
<i>Précis de la Géog.</i>, tom. vi., pp. 470-1; <i>Humboldt</i>, in <i>Nouvelles
Annales des Voy.</i>, 1827, tom. xxxv., p. 329; <i>Hassel</i>, <i>Mex. Guat.</i>, pp. 385-6;
<i>Cortés</i>, <i>Adventuras</i>, p. 321, and in many other works mentioned in connection
with matter from later sources. Next we have the exploration of
Colonel Juan Galindo, an officer in the Central American service, sometime
governor of the province of Peten, made in April, 1835. An account of his
observations was forwarded to the <span xml:lang="fr">Société de Géographie</span> of Paris, and published
in the <i>Bulletin</i> of that Society, and also in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> of
London. A communication on the subject was also published in <i>Amer. Antiq.
Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 545-50; and the information furnished to the
French Geographical Society was published en résumé in <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom.
i., div. ii., pp. 73, 76. Ten drawings accompanied Galindo's report, but
have never been published, although the author announced the intention of
the Central American government to publish his report in full with plates.
He says, '<span xml:lang="fr">je suis le seul qui ait examiné les ruines de Copan, et qui en ait
fait la relation,</span>' but he knew nothing of Palacio's visit. 'Not being an
artist, his account is necessarily unsatisfactory and imperfect, but it is not
exaggerated.' <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. i., p. 132. 'Had an enquiring
mind, but a very superficial Education.' <i>Squier's Pref.</i> to <i>Palacio</i>, <i>Carta</i>, p. 8.
Most of Galindo's account is also given with that of Juarros, in <i>Bradford's
Amer. Antiq.</i>, pp. 96-9; also some information from the same source in
<i>Brownell's Ind. Races</i>, p. 52, and in <i>Larenaudière</i>, <i>Mex. et Guat.</i>, p. 267.
In 1839 Messrs Stephens and Catherwood visited Copan. Mr Stephens,
as I find by a careful examination of his book, spent thirteen days in his survey,
namely, from November 17 to 30; while Mr Catherwood spent the
larger part of another month in completing his drawings. The results of
their labors appeared in 1841 and 1844 under the titles:&mdash;<i>Stephens' Incidents
of Travel in Central America</i>, vol. i., pp. 95-160, with twenty-one plates
and seven cuts; <i>Catherwood's Views of Ancient Monuments in Central
America</i>, in folio, with large lithographic plates. Slight descriptions of the
ruins, made up chiefly from Stephens, may be found as follows:&mdash;<i>Helps'
Span. Conq.</i>, vol. iii., pp. 54-5; <i>Willson's Amer. Hist.</i>, pp. 76-9, with plan
and cut; <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1841, tom. xcii., pp. 64-74, 57, with
plan and plates; <i>Jones' Hist. Anc. Amer.</i>, pp. 57-69, 116; <i>Davis' Antiq.

<i>Tiedemann</i>, <i>Heidelb. Yahrb.</i>, 1851, p. 85; <i>Larenaudière</i>, <i>Mex. et Guat.</i>,
pl. 9-12, the text being from Galindo and Juarros; <i>Reichardt</i>, <i>Cent. Amer.</i>,
pp. 91-2; <i>Amérique Centrale</i>, <i>Colonization</i>, pt. ii., p. 68; <i>Müller</i>, <i>Amerikanische
Urreligionen</i>, pp. 462-4, 483; <i>Macgregor's Progress of Amer.</i>, pp.
877-8; <i>Frost's Great Cities of the World</i>, pp. 279-82, with cut. Dr Scherzer
in 1856 started to explore Copan, but, owing to the political state of the
country at the time, was unable to get nearer than Santa Rosa, where the
padre said moreover that recent land-slides had much injured the effect of
the ruins. This author gives, however, a brief account made up from
Stephens, Galindo, and Juarros. <i>Scherzer's Trav.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 41, 86-7, 94-5.
<i>Id.</i>, <i>Wanderungen</i>, pp. 332, 366, 371. In September, 1856, the Jesuit Padre
Cornette is said to have visited the ruins; M. César Daly, at a date not
mentioned, prepared on the spot plans and drawings of the different structures
which he intended to publish in the <i><span xml:lang="fr">Revue Générale de l'Architecture</span></i>,
but whether or not they have ever appeared, I know not; the Abbé Brasseur
de Bourbourg made two visits to Copan in 1863 and 1866; some slight
additional information on the subject was communicated by Mr Center, on
authority not given, at a meeting of the American Ethnological Society
in February, 1860; and Mr Hardcastle, who had spent several weeks in
exploring the ruins, furnished some farther notes at a meeting of the same
society in April, 1862; and, finally, photographs were made of the ruins by
M. Ellerly, director of the Alotepeque silver-mines. But these later explorations
have not as yet afforded the public much information, except that the
photographs mentioned, when compared by Brasseur de Bourbourg with
Catherwood's plates, show the latter as well as Stephens' descriptions to be
strictly accurate. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, tom. i., p. 96,
tom. ii., p. 493; <i>Id.</i>, <i>Palenqué</i>, pp. 8, 17; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vol. v., p. 114, vol.
vi., p. 154.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_III-14" href="#FNanchor_III-14"><span class="label">[III-14]</span></a> The only unfavorable criticism of Mr Stephens' work within my
knowledge, is that 'the Soul of History is wanting!' 'The Promethean
spark by which the flame of historic truth should illuminate his work, and
be viewed as a gleaming beacon from afar, to direct wanderers through the
dark night of wonders, has found no spot to rest upon and to vivify!' <i>Jones'
Hist. Anc. Amer.</i>, p. 55. And we may thank heaven for the fault when
we consider the effects of the said 'Promethean spark' in the work of the
immortal Jones.</p>

hammock ever existed here is in the highest degree improbable; yet the
padre at Gualan told Stephens that he had seen it, and an Indian had heard
it spoken of by his grandfather. <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. i., p. 144.</p>

76. Galindo's drawings also included a plan. By reason of the disagreement
between Stephens' plan and text in the matter of dimensions, I have
omitted the scale as useless. The southern wall of the enclosure, to accommodate
the size of my page, I have placed some two hundred feet north of
its true position. Those portions of the temple shaded by cross-lines are
the portions still standing according to the survey.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_III-18" href="#FNanchor_III-18"><span class="label">[III-18]</span></a> The southern wall in one place rises 30 or 40 feet in steps. <i>Stephens'

often six feet by three or four, with mortar in the interstices.' <i>Hardcastle</i>, in

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_III-19" href="#FNanchor_III-19"><span class="label">[III-19]</span></a> According to Stephens' text, which states that the river or west side is
624 feet, and the whole line of survey, which cannot in this case mean anything
but the circumference, is 2866 feet, thus leaving 809 feet each for the
northern and southern sides. His plan, and consequently my own, makes
the dimensions about 790 feet north and south by 600 east and west, the
circuit being thus 2780 feet. 'Not so large as the base of the great Pyramid
of Ghizeh.' <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. i., pp. 133. Galindo, <i>Amer. Antiq.
Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. ii., p. 547, makes the dimensions 750 feet east and west
(He calls it north and south, but on the supposition that the ruins are on
the north bank of the river instead of the east) by 600 feet north and south,
a circumference of 2700 feet; or if his measurements be understood to be
Spanish, their English equivalent would be about 690 by 552 feet, circuit
2484 feet. The same author, <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 76, gives 653
by 524, and 2354 feet; or if French measure be understood, its equivalent is
696 by 588, and 2568 feet. As large as Saint Peter's at Rome. <i>Davis' Antiq.

is stated by Stephens to be only 20 feet wide; according to the plan it is at
least 50 feet. <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. i., pp. 142-4, 133, 140. The pavement
of the court is 20 yards above the river; the gallery through the terrace
is 4 feet high and 2½ feet wide; the vault below the court is 5½ by
10 by 6 feet, its length running north and south with 9° variation of the

the idea of Fuentes respecting these statues, clad in Spanish habits; that of
the <span xml:lang="es">Licenciado</span> Palacio is as follows: '<span xml:lang="es">Una estátua grande, de más que quatro
varas de alto, labrada como un obispo vestido de pontificial, con su mitra
bien labrada y anillos en las manos.</span>' In the plaza, which would seem to be
the court A, where no statues were found by Stephens, were '<span xml:lang="es">seis estátuas

<i>Palacio</i>, in <i>Pacheco</i>, <i>Col. Doc. Inéd.</i>, tom. vi., pp. 37-8. Galindo says
'there are seven obelisks still standing and entire, in the temple and its
immediate vicinity; and there are numerous others, fallen and destroyed,
throughout the ruins of the city. These stone columns are ten or eleven
feet high, and about three broad, with a less thickness; on one side were
worked, in <i>basso-relievo</i>, (Stephens states, on the contrary, that all are cut in
<i>alto-relievo</i>) human figures, standing square to the front, with their hands
resting on their breast; they are dressed with caps on their heads, and sandals
on their feet, and clothed in highly adorned garments, generally reaching
half way down the thigh, but sometimes in long pantaloons. Opposite
this figure, at a distance of three or four yards, was commonly placed a
stone table or altar. The back and sides of the obelisk generally contain
phonetic hieroglyphics in squares. Hard and fine stones are inserted (naturally?)
in many obelisks, as they, as well as the rest of the works in the
ruins, are of a species of soft stone, which is found in a neighbouring and most
extensive quarry.' <i>Galindo</i>, in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. ii., p.
548; and in <i>Bradford's Amer. Antiq.</i>, p. 97. A bust 1<sup>m.</sup>, 68 high, belonging

div. ii., p. 76. Pillars so loaded with attributes that some scrutiny is required
to discover from the head in the centre that they represent a human form.
An altar not infrequently found beside them would, if necessary, show their
use. They are sun-pillars, such as are found everywhere in connection with
an ancient sun-religion. <i>Müller</i>, <i>Amerikanische Urreligionen</i>, p. 464.</p>

with a comparison of the cross-legged chiefs to certain ornaments of Xochicalco.
<i>Tylor's Anahuac</i>, p. 190. The altar is described by Galindo as a very
remarkable stone table in the temple, 'two feet four inches high, and four
feet ten inches square; its top contains forty-nine square tablets of hieroglyphics;
and its four sides are occupied by sixteen human figures in <i>basso-relievo</i>,
sitting cross-legged, on cushions carved in the stone, and bearing each
in their hands something like a fan or flapper.' <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc., Transact.</i>,
vol. ii., p. 548. To Mr Jones, possessed as that gentleman is with
the 'Soul of History,' this altar is the 'Rosetta-stone' of American antiquity.
The four supporting stones are eggs; serpents occur in the ornaments;
the objects held in the hands of the lesser personages of the sides
are spiral shells; the figures are seated cross-legged, or in the oriental style;
one chief holds a sceptre, the other none. Now these interpretations are
important to the author, since he claims that the <i>serpent</i> was the good demon
of the Tyrians; a serpent entwining an <i>egg</i> is seen on Tyrian coins; the
<i>spiral shell</i> was also put on Tyrian medals in honor of the discovery of the
famous purple; the style of sitting is one practiced in Tyre; the chief representing
Tyre holds no sceptre, because Tyre had ceased to be a nation at
the time of the event designed to commemorate. The conclusion is clear:
the altar was built in commemoration of an act of friendship between Tyre
and Sidon, by which act the people of the former nation were enabled to
migrate to America! <i>Jones' Hist. Anc. Amer.</i>, pp. 65-6, 156-62. More of
this in a future treatise on origin.</p>

industry of the workmen being more remarkable than their ideas or skill."

the Python, or the serpent killed by Cadmus!! Cabrera, <i><span xml:lang="es">Teatro Crítico</span></i>,

besides the engravings I have copied, and one of the other terra-cotta heads

positions of the plateau, the barranca, and the projecting fortress, together
with a view of El Resguardo and the other ruins in the distance. I do not

which, moreover, is easily comprehended without the aid of cuts. A
thorough exploration of Utatlan was made by Don Miguel Rivera y Maestre,
a commissioner sent for the purpose by the Guatemalan government in
1834. His MS. report to the state authorities was seen by Mr Stephens

details outside of Stephens' account. He does not state that his plans and
views were obtained from Rivera y Maestre. Juarros, <i>Hist. Guat.</i>, pp. 86-8,
487, follows Fuentes, who described the city chiefly from historical
accounts of its original condition, although it seems that he also visited the
ruins. Las Casas, <i>Hist. Apologética</i>, MS., cap. lii., speaks of Utatlan's

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-2" href="#FNanchor_V-2"><span class="label">[V-2]</span></a> The earliest modern account of Yucatan Antiquities with which I am
acquainted is that written by Sr Lorenzo de Zavala, Ambassador of the Mexican
Government in France, and published in <i>Antiquités Mexicaines</i>, tom.
i., div. ii., pp. 33-5. Sr Zavala visited Uxmal several years before 1834.
His communication gives a tolerably good general idea of the ruins, but it
is brief, unaccompanied by drawings, and relates only to one city. It is,
therefore, of little value when compared with later and more extensive
works on the subject, and is mentioned in this note only as being the earliest
account extant. Yet long before Zavala's visit, Padre Thomas de Soza,
a Franciscan friar of the convent of Mérida, had observed the ruins during
his frequent trips through the province, and he gave a slight account of
them to Antonio del Rio, who mentioned it in his <i>Descrip. of an Ancient
City</i>, pp. 6-8.</p>

<p class="footnote">M. Frédéric de Waldeck, a French artist, visited Uxmal in 1835 during
a short tour in the peninsula, and published the result of his labors in his
<i><span xml:lang="fr">Voyage Pittoresque et Archéologique dans la Province d'Yucatan</span></i>, Paris,
1838, large folio, with 22 steel plates and lithographic illustrations. M. de
Waldeck became in some way obnoxious to the Mexican Government,
which threw some obstacles in his way, and finally confiscated his drawings,
of which he had fortunately made copies. Waldeck in his turn
abuses the government and the people, and has consequently been unfavorably
criticised. His drawings and descriptions, however, tested by the
work of later visitors under better auspices, are remarkable for their accuracy
so far as they relate to antiquities. The few errors discoverable in his
work may be attributed to the difficulty of exploring alone and unaided
ruins enveloped in a dense tropical forest. 'Supplied with pecuniary aid
by a munificent and learned Irish peer.' (Lord Kingsborough.) <i>Foreign
Quar. Rev.</i>, vol. xviii., p. 251. '<span xml:lang="es">Waldeck, aumentando ó disminuyendo

<p class="footnote">Mr. John L. Stephens, accompanied by Fred. Catherwood, artist, at the
end of an antiquarian expedition through Central America, arrived at Uxmal
in 1840, and began the work of surveying the city, but the sickness of
Mr Catherwood compelled them to abandon the survey when but little
progress had been made and return abruptly to New York. The results of
their incomplete work were published in <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, N. Y.,
1841, vol. ii.</p>

<p class="footnote">Mr B. M. Norman, a resident of New Orleans, made a flying visit to
Yucatan from December to March, 1841-2, and published as a result <i>Rambles
in Yucatan</i>, N. Y., 1843, illustrated with cuts and lithographs. According
to the <i>Registro Yucateco</i>, tom. i., p. 372, this trip was merely a
successful speculation on the part of Norman, who collected his material
in haste from all available sources, in order to take advantage of the public
interest excited by Stephens' travels. However this may be, the work is
not without value in connection with the other authorities. 'The result of
a hasty visit.' <i>Mayer's Mex. Aztec, etc.</i>, vol. ii., p. 172. The work '<span xml:lang="fr">n'est

p. 150. 'A valuable work.' <i>Davis' Antiq. Amer.</i>, p. 12. 'By which the
public were again astonished and delighted.' <i>Frost's Pict. Hist. Mex.</i>,
p. 77. Norman's work is very highly spoken of and reviewed at length,
with numerous quotations and two plates, in the <i>Democratic Review</i>, vol.
xi., pp. 529-38.</p>

<p class="footnote">Mr Stephens arrived in New York on his return from his Central American
tour in July, 1840, having left Yucatan in June. 'About a year' after
his return he again sailed for Yucatan on October 9th and remained until
the following June. This is all the information the author vouchsafes
touching the date of his voyage, which was probably in 1841-2, Stephens
and Norman being therefore in the country at the same time; the latter
states, indeed, that they were only a month apart at Zayi. Stephens' work
is called <i>Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</i>, N. Y., 1843. (?) (Ed. quoted in
this work, N. Y., 1858.) The drawings of this and of the previous expedition
were published, with a descriptive text by Stephens, under the title of
<i>Catherwood's Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America</i>, N. Y.,
1844, large folio, with 25 colored lithographic plates. Stephens' account
was noticed, with quotations, by nearly all the reviews at the time of its
appearance, and has been the chief source from which all subsequent writers,
including myself, have drawn their information. His collection of
movable Yucatan relics was unfortunately destroyed by fire with Mr
Catherwood's panorama in New York. Critics are almost unanimous in
praise of the work. '<span xml:lang="fr">Malgré quelques imperfections, le livre restera toujours

<p class="footnote">The Baron von Friederichsthal, an attaché of the Austrian Legation,
spent several months in an examination of Yucatan ruins, confining his attention
to Chichen Itza and Uxmal. He had with him a daguerreotype apparatus,
and with its aid prepared many careful drawings. As to the date
of his visit it probably preceded those of Norman and Stephens, since
a letter by him, written while on his return to Europe, is dated April 21,
1841. This letter is printed in the <i>Registro Yucateco</i>, tom. ii., pp. 437-43,
and in the <i>Dicc. Univ.</i>, tom. x., pp. 290-3. It contains a very slight
general account of the ruins, which are spoken of as '<span xml:lang="es">hasta hoy desconocidas,</span>'
with much rambling speculation on their origin. On his arrival in
Europe Friederichsthal was introduced by Humboldt to the <span xml:lang="fr">Académie Royale
des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</span>, before which society he read a paper on
his discoveries on October 1, 1841, which paper was furnished by the author
for the <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1841, tom. xcii., pp. 297-314, where it
was published under the title of <i>Les Monuments de l'Yucatan</i>. The author
proceeded to Vienna where he intended to publish a large work with his
drawings, a work that so far as I know has never seen the light. '<span xml:lang="fr">M.

<p class="footnote">In 1858 M. Désiré Charnay visited Izamal, Chichen Itza, and Uxmal,
taking with him a photographic apparatus. He succeeded in obtaining
perfect views of many of the buildings, which were published under the
title <i><span xml:lang="fr">Cités et Ruines Américaines</span></i>, Paris, 1863, in large folio. The text of
the work is in octavo form and includes a long introduction by M. Viollet-le-Duc,
French Government Architect, occupied chiefly with speculation
and theories rather than descriptions. Charnay's part of the text, although
a most interesting journal of travels, is very brief in its descriptions, the
author wisely referring the reader to the photographs, which are invaluable
as tests of the correctness of drawings made by other artists both in Yucatan
and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-4" href="#FNanchor_V-4"><span class="label">[V-4]</span></a> Fray Diego Lopez Cogolludo visited Uxmal at some time before the
middle of the seventeenth century, and describes the ruins to some extent
in his <i>Historia de Yucathan</i>, Mad., 1688, pp. 176-7, 193-4, 197-8. Padre
Thomas de Soza, about 1786, reported to Antonio del Rio stone edifices covered
with stucco ornaments, known by the natives as Oxmutal, with statues
of men beating drums and dancing with palms in their hands, which he had
seen in his travels in Yucatan, and which are thought to be perhaps identical
with Uxmal, although the monuments are reported as being located twenty
leagues south of Mérida and may be quite as reasonably identified with some
other group. <i>Rio's Description</i>, pp. 6-7. Zavala's visit to Uxmal at some
date previous to 1834 has already been spoken of in <a href="#Footnote_V-2">note 2</a>. His account is
called <i><span xml:lang="fr">Notice sur les Monuments d'Ushmal</span></i>, in <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii.,
pp. 33-5. M. de Waldeck left Mérida for Uxmal on May 6, 1835, arrived at
the ruins on May 12, where he spent some eight days, and was interrupted
in his work by the rainy season. <i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, pp. 67-74, 93-104,
and plates. Mr Stephens had Waldeck's work with him at the time of his
second visit. He says, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 297, 'It will be found that our
plans and drawings differ materially from his, but Mr Waldeck was not an
architectural draughtsman;' yet the difference is only to be noted in a few
plates, and is not so material as Mr Stephens' words would imply. Still,
where differences exist, I give Mr Stephens the preference, because, having
his predecessor's drawings, his attention would naturally be called to all the
points of Waldeck's survey. Mr Stephens says further, 'It is proper to
say, moreover, that Mr Waldeck had much greater difficulties to encounter
than we, ... besides, he is justly entitled to the full credit of being the
first stranger who visited these ruins and brought them to the notice of the
public.' Mr Stephens' first visit was in June, 1840, during which he visited
the ruins from the hacienda three times, on June 20, 21, and 22, while
Mr Catherwood spent one day, the 21st, in making sketches. It was unfortunate
that he was forced by Mr Catherwood's illness to leave Uxmal, for
at this time the ground had been cleared of the forest and was planted with
corn; the occasion was therefore most favorable for a thorough examination.
<i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 413-35, with 3 plates. Mr
Norman, according to his journal, reached the ruins, where he took up his
abode, on February 25, 1842, and remained until March 4, devoting thus
seven days or thereabouts to his survey. His account is accompanied by
several lithographic illustrations. <i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, pp. 154-67.
Messrs Stephens and Catherwood arrived on their second visit on November
15, 1841, and remained until January 1, 1842, Mr Stephens meanwhile making
two short trips away, one in search of ruins, the other to get rid of fever
and ague. It is remarkable that they found no traces of Mr Friederichsthal's
visit, (<i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1841, tom. xcii., pp. 306-9,) which
was probably in the same year. <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>, vol. i., pp. 163-325, vol.
ii., pp. 264-73, with many plates and cuts. Padre Carrillo, cura of Ticul, with
D. Vicente García Rejon, and D. José María Fajardo, visited the ruins in
March, 1845, and an account of the visit, embodying but little information,
was published by <i>L. G.</i>, in <i>Registro Yuc.</i>, tom. i., pp. 275-9. Another
account of a visit in the same year was published by <i>M. F. P.</i>, in <i>Id.</i>,
pp. 361-70. Mr Carl Bartholomaeus Heller spent two or three days at
Uxmal, April 6 to 9, 1847. His account is found in <i>Heller</i>, <i>Reisen</i>, pp. 256-65.
M. Charnay's visit was in 1858, and his efforts to obtain photographic
negatives and to fight the insects which finally drove him away, lasted eight
days. <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, pp. 362-80, pl. xxxv-xlix. M. Brasseur
de Bourbourg was at Uxmal in 1865, and made a report, accompanied
by a plan, which was published in the <i>Archives de la Com. Scien. du Mex.</i>,
tom. ii., pp. 234, 254, as the author states in his <i>Palenqué</i>, Introd., p. 24.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-9" href="#FNanchor_V-9"><span class="label">[V-9]</span></a> In the plan I have followed Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 165, who determined
the position of all the structures by actual measurement, cutting
roads through the undergrowth for this express purpose, and the accuracy
of whose survey cannot be called in question. His plan is reproduced on
a reduced scale in <i>Willson's Amer. Hist.</i>, p. 83. Plans are also given in
<i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, pl. viii.; <i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 155; and
<i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, introd. by Viollet-le-Duc, p. 62. These all differ
very materially both from that of Stephens, and from each other; they are
moreover very incomplete, and bear marks of having been carelessly or
hastily prepared. '<span xml:lang="fr">Disposée en échiquier, où se déployaient, à la suite les

from nearly the same point (<i>q</i> on the plan looking southward) are given
by Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 305, and by Charnay, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>,

of the ruins by moonlight from a point and in a direction impossible to fix,
which is copied in the <i>Album Mex.</i>, tom. i., p. 203, in <i>Frost's Great
Cities</i>, p. 269, and in <i>Id.</i>, <i>Pict. Hist. Mex.</i>, p. 80. It makes a very pretty
frontispiece, which is about all that can be said in its favor, except that
it might serve equally well to illustrate any other group of American or
old-world antiquities.</p>

been a temple rather than a palace. 'Mr Stephens appears to be so strict
a Spartan Republican, that every large, or magnificent building in the
Ruined Cities, he considers to be a <i>Palace</i>,&mdash;he seems to have thought less

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-12" href="#FNanchor_V-12"><span class="label">[V-12]</span></a> In stating the dimensions of this mound, as I shall generally do in
describing Uxmal, I have followed Stephens' text. His plan and both
plans and text of all the other visitors vary more or less respecting each
dimension. I had prepared tables of dimensions for each building from all
the authorities, but upon reflection have thought it not worth while to insert
them. Such tables would not enable the reader to ascertain the exact
measurements, and moreover differences of a few feet cannot be considered
practically important in this and similar cases. All the authorities agree
on the general form and extent of this pyramidal mound. Most of them,
however, refer only to the eastern front, and no one but Stephens notes the
western irregularities. In giving the dimensions of the respective terraces
some also refer to their bases, and others probably to their summits. Norman,
<i>Rambles in Yuc.</i>, pp. 156-7, states that the second and third terraces
are each thirty feet high, while Charnay, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, pp. 372-3, makes
the same fifteen and ten feet respectively. Waldeck's plan makes the
summit platform about 240 feet long.</p>

number of rooms as being 18, although the plan shows 24. He probably does
not count the four small rooms corresponding with the recesses on the
front and rear, as he also does not include their doors in his count. How
he gets rid of the other two does not appear. Norman says 24 rooms, Charnay
21, and Stephens indicates 22 in the plan in <i>Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., p.

'The ornaments were composed of small square pieces of stone, shaped with
infinite skill, and inserted between the mortar and stone with the greatest care
and precision. About two-thirds of the ornaments are still remaining upon the
façade.... The ground-work of the ornaments is chiefly composed of raised
lines, running diagonally, forming diamond or lattice-work, over which are
rosettes and stars; and, in bold relief, the beautiful Chinese border.' <i>Norman's

From this rather meagre information Mr Jones proves, in a manner entirely
satisfactory to himself, that the whole platform was surrounded in its original

Although Stephens says the pyramid is only sixty-five feet high, it is noticeable
that in Catherwood's drawing it towers high above the roof of the
Casa del Gobernador, which is at least sixty-eight feet in height. Norman,
<i>Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 157, calls this a pile of loose stones, about two hundred
feet square at the base, and one hundred feet high, and covered on the sides
and top with débris of edifices. Friederichsthal, <i>Nouvelles Annales des

feet square.</p>

foundation of ten feet. Its width is twenty-five feet; having ranges of
rooms in both sides, only parts of which remain. This wall has an acute-angled
arch doorway through the centre.... The top of this wall has
numerous square apertures through it, which give it the appearance of
pigeon-holes; and its edge is formed like the gable-end of a house, uniformly

stone walls, leading to the Nun's House,' C of the plan. He says, also, that
some of the scattered mounds in this direction have been excavated and
seem to have been intended originally for sepulchres.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-32" href="#FNanchor_V-32"><span class="label">[V-32]</span></a> Mr Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 320, refers to his appendix for a mention
of some of the relics found in this group. The reference is probably to
a note on vestiges of the phallic worship on p. 434, which from motives of
modesty the author gives in Latin.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-33" href="#FNanchor_V-33"><span class="label">[V-33]</span></a> Mr Norman's statements, <i>Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 166, differ materially
from those of Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., pp. 298-9. He states that the walls
are only twelve feet apart, that the eastern façade only has the entwined
serpents, that the western is covered with hieroglyphics, that the structure
contains rooms on a level with the ground, and implies that the western
ring was still perfect at the time of his visit. This building is called by
Charnay the Cárcel, or Prison.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-34" href="#FNanchor_V-34"><span class="label">[V-34]</span></a> In these dimensions I have followed Mr Stephens' text, as usual in
Uxmal, as far as possible. Although the Casa de Monjas has received more
attention than any of the other structures, yet, strangely enough, no visitor
gives all the dimensions of the buildings and terraces; hardly any two
authors agree on any one dimension; and no author's text agrees exactly
with his plans. Yet the figures of my text may be considered approximately
correct. I append, however, in this instance a table of variations
as a curiosity.</p>

<p class="footnote">Respecting the height of the buildings, except the northern, we have no
figures from any reliable authority; but we know that both eastern and
western are lower than the northern building and higher than the southern,
whose rooms are 17 feet high on the inside, and moreover that the eastern
is higher than the western.</p>

which, so far as the arrangement of rooms and doorways is concerned, differs
very widely from that of Stephens, and must be regarded as very incorrect.
M. Waldeck, during his short stay in Yucatan, seems to have
devoted his chief attention to sketching the sculptured façades, a work
which he accomplished accurately, but to have constructed his plans from
memory and imagination after leaving the country. In the preparation of
the present plan he had, to aid his fancy, the supposed occupation of these
buildings in former times by nuns, and he has arranged the rooms with an
eye to the convenience of the priests in keeping a proper watch and guard
over the movements of those erratic demoiselles.</p>

They are reproduced in <i>Larenaudière</i>, <i>Mex. et Guat.</i>, p. 323, pl. 3, 6. The
perfect accuracy of the engravings&mdash;except the seated statues&mdash;is proved by
Charnay's photographs 42, 49, which show the same front, as does the view
in <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 305. The southern front of this building
is only shown in general views in <i>Stephens' Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., p. 420; repeated

Ce trophée est un ensemble de barres parallèles terminées par des têtes de
monstres. Au milieu de la partie supérieure, et touchant à la corniche, se
trouve une énorme tête humaine, encadrée à l'égyptienne, avec une corne de

à l'édifice une grande richesse d'effet. Les coins ont toujours cette
ornementation bizarre, composée de grandes figures d'idoles superposées,
avec un nez disproportionné, tordu et relevé, qui fait songer à la manière
chinoise.</span>' <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, pp. 366-7. The first of my engravings
I take from <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 306; the same front being shown
also in Charnay's photograph 38, in Waldeck's pl. xv., and in <i>Larenaudière</i>,
<i>Mex. et Guat.</i>, pl. 3. The second engraving is from Waldeck's pl. xvi.,
given also in <i>Larenaudière</i>, <i>Mex. et Guat.</i>, pl. 5, in <i>Norman's Rambles in
Yuc.</i>, p. 156&mdash;where it is incorrectly stated to represent a portion of the
Casa del Gobernador,&mdash;and corresponding with Charnay's photograph 39.
The third cut is from <i>Viollet-le-Duc</i>, in <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, p. 65. M.
Viollet-le-Duc explains the cut as follows: '<span xml:lang="fr">Supposons des piles ou murs
de refend A; si l'on pose à la tête des piles les premiers patins B, sur lesquels,
à angle droit, on embrévera les traverses C, puis les secondes pièces
B', les deuxièmes traverses C' en encorbellement égalemente embérvées, et
ainsi de suite, on obtient, au droit des têtes de piles ou murs de refend, des
parois verticales, et, dans le sens des ouvertures, des parois inclinées arrivant
à porter les filières D avec potelets intercalés. Si, d'une pile à l'autre, on
pose les linteaux E en arrière du nu des pièces BB', et que sur ces linteaux
on établisse des treillis, on obtiendra une construction de bois primitive,
qui est évidemment le principe de la décoration de la façade de pierre du
bâtiment.</span>' This façade is 'the most chaste and simple in design and ornament,
and it was always refreshing to turn from the gorgeous and elaborate
masses on the other façades to this curious and pleasing combination.' <i>Stephens'
Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 306. 'The eastern façade is filled with elaborate
ornaments, differing entirely from the others, and better finished.' <i>Norman's
Rambles in Yuc.</i>, pp. 161-2. '<span xml:lang="fr">Les huit échelons dont la série forme un cône
renversé, sont ornés, à chacune de leurs extrémités, d'une tête symbolique
de serpent ou de dragon. La tête du Soleil qui touche à la corniche et repose
sur le troisième échelon, offre deux rayons ascendants, indépendemment
de ceux qui flamboient autour du masque, dont je n'ai pu deviner la
signification. Les trois rayons qui se voient au dessus de la tête ont peut-être
quelques rapports avec le méridien, celui du milieu indiquant le parfait
équilibre.' 'Des sept masques solaires, un seul était intact.' 'L'ensemble
de cette façade offre à l'heure de midi un caractère de grandeur dont il
serait difficile de donner une idée.</span>' <i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, pp. 102-3.</p>

Rattlesnakes are common in this region. The proprietor proposed to build
this serpent's head into a house in Mérida as a memorial of Uxmal.
'Toward the south end the head and tail of the serpents corresponded
in design and position with the portion still existing at the other.' <i>Id.</i>,
vol. i., pp. 302-3. 'The remains of two great serpents, however, are
still quite perfect; their heads turned back, and entwining each other, they
extend the whole length of the façade, through a chaste ground-work of
ornamental lines, interspersed with various rosettes. They are put together
by small blocks of stone, exquisitely worked, and arranged with the nicest
skill and precision. The heads of the serpents are adorned with ppluming
feathers and tassels.' <i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 162. '<span xml:lang="fr">Son nom lui
vient d'un immense serpent à sonnettes courant sur toute la façade, dont le
corps, se roulant en entrelacs, va servir de cadre à des panneaux divers. Il

six croisillons, avec rosace à l'intérieur; une statue d'Indien s'avance en
relief de la façade, il tient à la main un sceptre; on remarque au-dessus de
sa tête un ornement figurant une couronne.</span>' <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, p.

impressions. Pourquoi n'avouerais-je pas qu'il s'y mêle un peu de
vanité? Un pareil sentiment n'est-il pas excusable chez le voyageur qui
révèle au monde civilisé des trésors archéologiques si longtemps ignorés, un
style nouveau d'architecture, et une source abondante où d'autres, plus savants

than the others.' <i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 161. Norman's general
view of the Nunnery includes a view of this northern front, but the
decorations are omitted and the turrets also. '<span xml:lang="fr">Chaque porte, de deux en

comme par hasard de l'arrangement des pierres, et rappellent les
têtes énormes sculptées sur les palais de Chichen-Itza. Des méandres de
pierres finement travaillées leur servent de cadre et donnent une vague idée
de caractères hiéroglyphiques: puis viennent une succession de grecques de
grande dimension, alternées, aux angles, de carrés et de petites rosaces d'un
fini admirable. Le caprice de l'architecte avait jeté çà et là, comme des
démentis à la parfaite régularité du dessin, des statues dans les positions les

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-47" href="#FNanchor_V-47"><span class="label">[V-47]</span></a> I append a few general quotations concerning the Nunnery: The court
façades 'ornamented from one end to the other with the richest and most
intricate carving known in the art of the builders of Uxmal; presenting a
scene of strange magnificence, surpassing any that is now to be seen among
its ruins.' <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>, vol. i., p. 300. 'All these façades were painted;
the traces of the colour are still visible, and the reader may imagine what
the effect must have been when all this building was entire, and according
to its supposed design, in its now desolate doorways stood noble Maya
maidens, like the vestal virgins of the Romans, to cherish and keep alive
the sacred fire burning in the temples.' <i>Id.</i>, p. 307. The bottoms of the
caissons of the diamond lattice-work are painted red. The paint is believed
to be a mixture in equal parts of carmine and vermilion, probably vegetable
colors. <i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, pp. 200-1; Zavala, in <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i.,
div. ii., pp. 33-4, describes a building supposed to be the Nunnery on
account of the serpent ornament, which, however, is stated to be on the
exterior front of the building. Cogolludo, <i>Hist. Yuc.</i>, p. 177, describes the
court and surrounding edifices, stating that the serpent surrounds all four
sides. '<span xml:lang="es">Vn gran patio con muchos aposentos separados en forma de claustro
donde viuian estas doncellas. Es fabrica digna de admiracion, porque lo
exterior de las paredes es todo de piedra labrada, donde estàn sacadas de
medio relieue figuras de hombres armados, diuersidad de animales, pajaros,
y otras cosas.' 'Todos los quatro lienços de aquel gran patio (que se puede
llamar plaça) los ciñe vna culebra labrada en la misma piedra de las paredes,
que termina la cola por debaxo de la cabeça, y tiene toda ella en circuito
quatrocientos pies.</span>' Jones, <i>Hist. Anc. Amer.</i>, p. 93, accounts for the
superiority of the sculpture on the court façades by supposing that it was
executed at a later date; its protection from the weather would also tend to
its better preservation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-48" href="#FNanchor_V-48"><span class="label">[V-48]</span></a> Although Zavala says, speaking of the Uxmal ruins in general: '<span xml:lang="fr">Celles
qui forment l'arête à partir de laquelle les plans des murs convergent
pour déterminer la voûte prismatique dont j'ai déjà parlé, sont taillées en
forme de coude dont l'angle est obtus.</span>' <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 34.
'In the rear of, and within a few feet of the eastern range, are the remains
of a similar range, which is now almost in total ruins. There appear to
have been connecting walls, or walks, from this range to the Pyramid near
by, as I judged from the rubbish and stones that can be traced from one to
the other.' <i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 162. Cuts from <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>,
vol. i., pp. 311, 430; one of them reproduced in <i>Baldwin's Anc. Amer.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-49" href="#FNanchor_V-49"><span class="label">[V-49]</span></a> So say Stephens' text and plan, Viollet-le-Duc, and Charnay's plan;
but Stephens' views, except that in <i>Cent. Amer.</i>, Charnay's photographs,
and Waldeck's plan and drawings, do not indicate an oval form. I am inclined
to believe that the corners are simply rounded somewhat more than
in the other Uxmal structures, and that the oval form indicated in the plan
is not correct.</p>

variations as the other structures&mdash;Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, being the authority
followed. Waldeck makes the platform 45 by 91 feet 8 inches, and the
building 81 feet 8 inches by 14 feet 8 inches. Zavala calls the building 8
metres square. According to Norman the pyramid measures 500 feet at the
base, and is 100 feet high, the platform being 21 by 72 feet, and the building
12 by 60, and 20 feet high. Charnay pronounces the pyramid 75 to 80
feet high. Stephens, <i>Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 421-2, gives the dimensions
as follows: Pyramid, 120 by 240 feet at base; platform, 4½ feet wide outside
the building; building, 68 feet long; rooms, 9 feet wide, 18, 18, and 34 feet
long. Friederichsthal's dimensions: Pyramid, 120 by 192 feet and 25½ feet
high; platform, 23⅓ by 89 feet; building, 12 by 73 feet, and 19¼ feet high.
<i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1841, tom. xcii., p. 307. Heller's dimensions:
Pyramid, 135 by 225 feet, and 105 feet high; platform, 20 by 70 feet; building,
12 by 60 feet, and 20 feet high.</p>

toutes ces figures étaient plus particulièrement mutilées dans cette partie

accompanying portion of the wall. 'The emblems of life and death appear
on the wall in close juxtaposition, confirming the belief in the existence of
that worship practiced by the Egyptians, and all other eastern nations, and
before referred to as prevalent among the people of Uxmal.' <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>,
vol. i., p. 314. 'The western façade is ornamented with human
figures similar to <i>caryatides</i>, finely sculptured in stone with great art.'
<i>Norman's Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 164. It is astonishing how easy the meaning
of these sculptures may be deciphered when the right person undertakes
the task. For instance: 'The translation of the above Sculpture seems as
easy as if a <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> had already read the handwriting on the wall! as thus&mdash;The
human figure, in full life and maturity, together with the sex, presents
mortality; over the figure the <i>cross-bones</i> are placed, portraying the figure's
earthly death; while the skull supported by expanding wings (and this Sculpture
being placed above those of life and death,) presents the immortal Soul
ascending on the wings of Time, above all earthly life, or the corruption of
the grave!' <i>Jones' Hist. Anc. Amer.</i>, p. 103.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-55a" href="#FNanchor_V-55a"><span class="label">[V-55]</span></a> Stephens, <i>Yucatan</i>, vol. i., pp. 312, 316, gives views of the east and
west fronts, the former of which I have inserted in my description; and in
<i>Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., p. 420, a view from the south, which is copied in <i>Armin</i>,
<i>Das Heutige Mex.</i>, p. 92, which last authority also gives what seems to
be a restoration of the pyramid from Waldeck. Waldeck's plates, ix., x.,
xi., relate to this structure; plate ix. is a view from a point above the whole
and directly over the centre, including a ground plan of the summit building;
plate x. is the western elevation of the pyramid and building with the
eastern elevation of the latter; and plate xi. is a view of one of the statues
as already mentioned. Charnay's photograph 35 gives a western view of
the whole, which is also included in photograph 38; it is to be noted that
his plan places the Casa del Adivino considerably south of the Nunnery.
Norman, <i>Rambles in Yuc.</i>, p. 162, gives an altogether imaginary view of
the pyramid and building, perhaps intended for the western front. '<span xml:lang="fr">La base
de la colline factice est revêtue d'un parement vertical avec une frise dans
laquelle on retrouve l'imitation des rondins de bois, surmontés d'une sorte
de balustrade presque entièrement détruite.</span>' <i>Viollet-le-Duc</i>, in <i>Charnay</i>,
<i>Ruines Amér.</i>, p. 70. On the east front of the building are '<span xml:lang="fr">deux portes
carrées et deux petits pavillons couverts d'une espèce de toit reposant
sur des pilastres.' 'Tel est ce monument, chef-d'&oelig;uvre d'art et d'élégance.

dessin complet; le centre avait été dégradé par suite de l'extraction de
quelques pierres nécessaires à la solidité de cette partie de l'édifice.</span>' <i>Waldeck</i>,
<i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, p. 96. Yet if the structure was as perfect and his examination
as complete as he claims, it is very strange, to say the least, that he
did not discover the apartments in the western projections. Zavala, in <i>Antiq.
Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 33, says that the interior walls of this building are
plastered. Stephens, Charnay, and Brasseur, <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, tom. ii., pp.
578-88, give the tradition of the Dwarf, which gives this temple one of its
names. 'The construction of these ornaments is not less peculiar and
striking than the general effect. There were no tablets or single stones,
each representing separately and by itself an entire subject; but every ornament
or combination is made up of separate stones, on each of which part of
the subject was carved, and which was then set in its place in the wall.'
'Perhaps it may, with propriety, be called a species of sculptured mosaic.'

which, in distances and the arrangement of the buildings with respect to
each other, presents not the slightest similarity with the probably accurate
drawings of Stephens and Catherwood. 'The ruins of Chichen lie on a
hacienda, called by the name of the ancient city.' 'The first stranger who
ever visited them was a native of New-York,' Mr John Burke. First
brought to the notice of the world by Friederichsthal. 'The plan is made
from bearings taken with the compass, and the distances were all measured
with a line. The buildings are laid down on the plan according to their
exterior form. All now standing are comprehended, and the whole circumference
occupied by them is about two miles ... though ruined buildings
appear beyond these limits.' 'In all the buildings, from some cause not
easily accounted for, while one varies ten degrees one way, that immediately
adjoining varies twelve or thirteen degrees in another;' still the plan
shows no such arrangement. <i>Stephens' Yucatan</i>, vol. ii., pp. 282-3, 290, 312.

the monsters' heads given in my text. Bishop Landa gives a description
probably intended for this edifice and even gives a plan of it. His account,
except in mentioning four stairways, agrees very well with that of later
visitors, and is as follows: 'This edifice has four stairways facing the four
parts of the world; they are 33 feet wide, each having 91 steps, very difficult
of ascent. The steps have the same height and width as ours. Each
stairway has two low balustrades, two feet wide, of good stonework like all
the building. The edifice is not sharp-cornered, because from the ground
upward between the balustrades the cubic blocks are rounded, ascending
by degrees and elegantly narrowing the building. There was, when I saw
it, at the foot of each balustrade a fierce serpent's mouth very strangely
worked. Above the stairways there is on the summit a small level platform
in which is an edifice of four rooms. Three of them extend round
without interruption, each having a door in the middle and being covered
with an arch. The northern room is of peculiar form, and has a corridor of
great pillars. The middle one, which must have been a kind of little court
between the rooms, has a door which leads to the northern corridor and is
closed with wood at the top, and served for burning perfumes. In the entrance
of this door or corridor is a kind of coat of arms sculptured in stone,
which I could not well understand.' <i>Landa</i>, <i>Relacion</i>, pp. 342-4. 550 feet
in circumference at the base, its sides facing the cardinal points. 'The
angles and sides were beautifully laid with stones of an immense size, gradually
lessening, as the work approached the summit.' Stairways on north
and east 30 feet wide and narrowing toward the top. The south and west
slopes also mount in steps, each four feet high. Monsters' heads at foot
of eastern stairway. Slope 100 feet; building 42 feet square; stone door-jambs
have holes drilled through their inner angles; interior walls are plastered

Schott pronounces Mr Stephens' description unsatisfactory, especially his
calling the face harsh and stern in expression. The features are feminine
in their cast, and of the narrow rather than of the broad type. 'The whole
face exhibits a very remarkable regularity and conforms strictly to the universally
accepted principles of beauty.' 'The head-dress in the shape of a
mitre is encircled just above the forehead by a band, which is fastened in
front by a triple locket or tassel.' This author identities the face as that of
Itzamatul, the semi-divine founder of Izamal, and explains the signification of
each particular feature. His treatise is perhaps as intelligible and rational
as most speculation on such topics, but it is to be noted that the Dr founds
his conclusions on Clavigero's description of the Toltecs! It would be hard
to prove that the cara gigantesca does not represent this particular hero, and
that the large ears are not emblems of wisdom. Dr Schott pronounces it
'hazardous' to attempt to connect this face with any other than Itzamatul,
and I prefer to run no risks. <i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1869, pp. 389-93.

ancient Mayas. It is now difficult to ascertain whether these quarries or
galleries, which, according to the traditions of the country, are understood
to be immense, served for the abode of the people who executed the work.
Nothing reveals the marks of man's sojournings here; not even the traces
of smoke upon the vaults were visible. It is more probable that the greater
part of this excavation was used as a depository for their dead. This supposition
has been strengthened by the discovery of many openings of seven
feet deep by twenty inches in breadth, dug horizontally in the walls of the
caverns. These excavations, however, are few; and the galleries have been
but little investigated and less understood.' Mr Norman sent some of the
skeletons discovered here to Dr Morton, who pronounced them to present
many of the characteristics of the natives at the present time. <i>Norman's

M. Morelet visited Palenque from the Laguna de Terminos, passing up the
Usumacinta and its branches, while other visitors approached for the most
part from the opposite direction. He gives, moreover, much closer attention
to nature in its varied aspects than to artificial monuments of the past.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VI-2" href="#FNanchor_VI-2"><span class="label">[VI-2]</span></a> In 1746, while Padre Antonio de Solis was temporarily residing at
Santo Domingo, a part of his curacy, the ruins were accidentally found by
his nephews; although Stephens, <i>Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., p. 294, gives a report
without naming his authority&mdash;probably <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. i.,
p. v., or <i>Juarros</i>, <i>Hist. Guat.</i>, p. 18., where the date is given as the middle
of the century&mdash;which he does not credit, that they were found by a party
of Spaniards in 1750. From one of the nephews, Ramon Ordoñez, then a
schoolboy at San Cristóval, first heard of the ruins in which he took so deep
an interest in later years. In 1773 Ordoñez sent his brother with one Gutierrez
de la Torre and others to make explorations, and from their report
wrote an account&mdash;probably the <i><span xml:lang="es">Memoria relativa à las ruinas de la Ciudad
descubierta en las inmediaciones del pueblo de Palenque</span></i>, a MS. in Brasseur's
collection, (<i>Bib. Mex. Guat.</i>, p. 113,) from which these facts were gathered&mdash;which
was forwarded in 1784 to Estacheria, President of the Guatemalan
Audiencia Real. President Estacheria, by an order dated Nov. 28, 1784,&mdash;<i><span xml:lang="es">Expediente
sobre el descubrimiento de una gran ciudad, etc.</span></i>, MS., in the
Archives of the Royal Hist. Acad. of Madrid,&mdash;instructed José Antonio
Calderon, Lieut. Alcalde Mayor of Santo Domingo, to make further explorations.
Calderon's report,&mdash;<i>Informe de D. J. A. Calderon, etc.</i>, translated
in substance in <i>Brasseur</i>, <i>Palenqué</i>, Introd., pp. 5-7,&mdash;is dated Dec. 15,
1764, so that the survey must have been very actively pushed, to bring to
light as was claimed, over 200 ruined edifices in so short a time. Some
drawings accompanied this report, but they have never been published. In
Jan. 1785 Antonio Bernasconi, royal architect in Guatemala, was ordered
to continue the survey, which he did between Feb. 25 and June 13, when
he handed in his report, accompanied by drawings never published so far as
I know. Bernasconi's report with all those preceding it was sent to Spain,
and from the information thus given, J. B. Muñoz, Royal Historiographer,
made a report on American antiquities by order of the king.</p>

<p class="footnote">In accordance with a royal cedula of March 15, 1786, Antonio del Rio
was ordered by Estacheria to complete the investigations. With the aid
of seventy-nine natives Del Rio proceeded to fall the trees and to clear the
site of the ancient city by a general conflagration. His examination lasted
from May 18 to June 2, and his report with many drawings was sent to
Spain. Copies were, however, retained in Guatemala and Mexico, and one
of these copies was in Brasseur's collection under the title of <i><span xml:lang="es">Descripcion
del terreno y poblacion antigua</span>, etc.</i> Another copy was found, part in
Guatemala and the rest in Mexico, by a Dr M'Quy. It was taken to England,
translated, and published by Henry Berthoud, together with a commentary
by Paul Felix Cabrera, entitled <i>Teatro Crítico Americano</i>, all
under the general title of <i>Description of an Ancient City, etc.</i>, London,
1822. The work was illustrated with eighteen lithographic plates, by M.
Fréd. Waldeck, ostensibly from Del Rio's drawings; but it is elsewhere
stated, <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. i., p. vi., that Del Rio's drawings did not
accompany the work at all. If this be true, the published plates must
probably have been taken from the Latour-Allard copies of Castañeda's
drawings, of which I shall speak presently, and indeed a comparison with
Kingsborough's plates shows almost conclusively that such was in some
cases at least their origin. Humboldt speaks of the Latour-Allard plate of
the cross as differing entirely from that of Del Rio. This difference does
not appear in my copies. It is possible that the plates in my copy of Del
Rio's work, the only one I have ever seen, are not the ones which originally
appeared with the book. A French translation by M. Warden was published
by the Société de Géographie, with a part of the plates; and a German
translation by J. H. von Minutoli, with an additional commentary by the
translator, appeared in Berlin, 1832, as <i><span xml:lang="de">Beschreibung einer alten Stadt</span></i>, etc.
This contained the plates, together with many additional ones illustrating
Mexican antiquities from various sources. The German editor says that
the whole English edition, except two copies of proof-sheets, was destroyed;
but this would seem an error, since the work is often referred to by different
writers, and the price paid for the copy consulted by me does not
indicate great rarity. Stephens, <i>Cent. Amer.</i>, vol. ii., p. 296, speaks of
this as 'the first notice in Europe of the discovery of these ruins,'&mdash;incorrectly,
unless we understand <i>printed</i> notice, and even then it must be
noticed that Juarros, <i>Hist. Guat.</i>, 1808-18, pp. 18-19, gave a brief account
of Palenque. Del Rio, in Brasseur's opinion, was neither artist nor architect,
and his exploration was less complete than those of Calderon and
Bernasconi, whose reports he probably saw, notwithstanding the greater
force at his disposal. '<span xml:lang="es">Sin embargo de sus distinguidas circunstancias,
carecia de noticias historiales para lo que pedia la materia, y de actividad
para lograr un perfecto descubrimiento.</span>' <i>Registro Yuc.</i>, tom. i., p. 320.
The original Spanish of Del Rio's report, dated June 24, 1787 (?),&mdash;<i>Informe
dado par D. Antonio del Rio al brigadier D. José Estacheria, etc.</i>&mdash;was
published in 1855, in the <i>Diccionario Univ. de Geog. etc.</i>, tom. viii., pp.
528-33. See also an extract from the same in <i>Mosaico Mex.</i>, tom. ii., pp.
330-4. In <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 76, it is stated that Julio Garrido
wrote a work on Palenque about 1805, which was not published. That
is all I know of it.</p>

<p class="footnote">From 1805 to 1808 Capt. Guillaume Dupaix, in company with Luciano
Castañeda, draughtsman, and a company of Mexican soldiers, by order
of Carlos IV., King of Spain, made three expeditions to explore the antiquities
of southern Mexico. Dupaix's MS. report, and 145 drawings by
Castañeda, were deposited in the Mexican archives to be sent to Spain;
but the revolution breaking out soon after, they were for some years forgotten.
Copies of most of the drawings were obtained by M. Latour-Allard
of Paris, passed through the hands of Humboldt, who did not publish
them, and later into English hands. They were engraved in London,
1823, without any accompanying explanation, and M. Warden reproduced
a part of them in a memoire to the French Geographical Society. These
are certainly the plates in my copy of Del Rio, and I have but little doubt
that they are the only ones that ever accompanied his published work.
Bullock, <i>Six Months' Residence in Mex.</i>, p. 330, says he copied Castañeda's
drawings in Mexico, 1823, but he published none of them. In 1831,
copies of the Latour-Allard copies, made by the artist Aglio, were published
by Lord Kingsborough, in vol. iv. of his <i>Mexican Antiquities</i>, together
with the Spanish text of Dupaix's report, obtained from I know
not what source, in vol. v., and a carelessly made English translation of the
same in vol. vi. of the same work. In 1828, the original text and drawings
were delivered by the Mexican authorities to M. Baradère&mdash;at least Sr
Icaza, curator of the Mexican Museum, certified them to be the originals;
but Sr Gondra, afterwards curator of the same institution, assured Brasseur
that these also were only copies,&mdash;and were published&mdash;the text in
Spanish and French&mdash;in 1843, in <i>Antiquités Mexicaines</i>. The faithfulness
with which the descriptions and drawings of Dupaix and Castañeda were
made, has never been called in question; but Castañeda was not a very
skilful artist, as is admitted by M. Farcy in his introduction to <i>Antiq.
Mex.</i>, and many of his faults of perspective were corrected in the plates of
that work. M. Farcy states that all previous copies of the plates were
very faulty, including those of Kingsborough, although Humboldt, in a
letter to M. Latour-Allard, testifies to the accuracy of the latter. A comparison
of the two sets of plates shows much difference in the details of a
few of them, and those of the official edition are doubtless superior. The
French editors, while criticising Kingsborough's plates more severely, as it
seems, than they deserve, say nothing whatever of his text; yet both in
the Spanish and translation it varies widely from the other, showing numerous
omissions and not a few evident blunders. Stephens, seconded by
Brasseur, objects to the slighting tone with which Dupaix's editors speak
of Del Rio's report; also to their claim that only by government aid can
such explorations be carried on. M. Waldeck says, <i>Palenqué</i>, p. vii., that
he tried to prevent the publication of the plates in Kingsborough's work on
account of their inaccuracy, although how he could at that date pretend
to be a judge in the matter does not appear. It is true that Castañeda's
drawings are not equal to those of Waldeck and Stephens, but they nevertheless
give an excellent idea of the general features of all ruins visited.
Morelet says of Dupaix's report: '<span xml:lang="fr">Ce document est encore aujourd'hui le
plus curieux et le plus intéressant que nous possédons sur les ruines de Palenque.</span>'
<i>Voyage</i>, tom. i., p. 268; <i>Travels</i>, p. 90. It was during the third
expedition, begun in December, 1807, that Dupaix visited Palenque with
a force of natives. His survey lasted several months. The results may

<p class="footnote">Dr F. Corroy, a French physician of Tabasco, lived 20 years in the
country and made several visits to Palenque, claiming to know more about
the ruins than anyone else. An inscription on one of the entrances of the
Palace, shown in <i>Waldeck</i>, pl. ix., reads '<span xml:lang="es">François Corroy de tercer viage
en estas ruinas los dias 25 de Agosto. Unico historiador de hellos. Con su
Esposa y Ija.</span>' He furnished some information from 1829 to 1832 to the
French Geographical Society, and speaks of 14 drawings and a MS. history
in his possession. <i>Soc. Géog., Bulletin</i>, tom. ix., No. 60, 1828, p. 198;
<i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 76. Col. Juan Galindo, at one time connected
with the British Central American service, also Governor of Peten,
and corresponding member of the London Geographical Society, sent
much information, with maps, plans, and sketches to the French Société
de Géographie. His letter dated April 27, 1831, describing the Palenque
ruins, is printed in <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., pp. 67-72, also an English
translation in the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, No. 769, London, 1831, which was
reprinted in the <i>Lond. Geog. Soc., Jour.</i>, vol. iii., pp. 60-2. Lafond, <i>Voyages</i>,
tom. i., p. 142, states that Nebel visited Palenque, and Müller, <i>Urreligionen</i>,
p. 459-60, also implies that this traveler explored the ruins; but
this is probably erroneous.</p>

<p class="footnote">On April 12, 1832, M. Fréderic de Waldeck, the most indefatigable and
successful explorer of Palenque, arrived at the ruined city, illustrative
plates of which he had engraved ten years before for Del Rio's work. This
veteran artist&mdash;64 years of age at that time, according to Brasseur's statement,
<i>Palenqué</i>, p. vi., but 67 if we may credit the current report in the
newspapers that he celebrated his 109th birthday in Paris on Dec. 7, 1874,
being still hale and hearty&mdash;built a cabin among the ruins and spent two
whole years in their examination,&mdash;Brasseur, <i>Palenqué</i>, p. vi., incorrectly
says <i>three</i> years. '<span xml:lang="fr">Deux ans de séjour sur les lieux,</span>' <i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>,
p. 68, translated 'in a sojourn of twelve years,' <i>Bradford's Amer. Antiq.</i>,
p. 86,&mdash;his expenses being paid by a subscription which was headed by
the Mexican Government. More than 200 drawings in water and oil
colors were the result of his labors, and these drawings, more fortunate
than those made the next year in Yucatan&mdash;see <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a> of this volume&mdash;escaped
confiscation, although Stephens erroneously states the contrary,
and were brought to France. <i>Waldeck</i>, <i>Voy. Pitt.</i>, p. vi. For various
reasons Waldeck was unable to publish his proposed work, and over 30
years elapsed before the result of his labors was made public, except
through communications dated Aug. 28, and Nov. 1, 1832, sent to the
Geographical Society at Paris. <i>Lafond</i>, <i>Voyages</i>, tom. i., p. 142. I
shall speak again of his work. Mr Friederichsthal visited Palenque in his
Central American travels before 1841, but neither his text nor plates, so far
as I know, have ever been published. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Palenqué</i>,
introd., p. 14. See <a href="#Page_146">pp. 146</a>-<a href="#Page_147">7</a> of this vol.</p>

<p class="footnote">In 1840, Messrs Stephens and Catherwood, after their exploration of the
antiquities of Honduras and Guatemala, reached Palenque on May 9, remaining
until June 4. Such are the dates given by Brasseur,&mdash;the only
antiquarian except myself who has ever had the hardihood to explore
Stephens' writings for dates,&mdash;but the actual examination of the ruins
lasted only from May 11 to June 1. The results are found in <i>Stephens'
Yuc.</i>, vol. ii., pp. 280-365, with 31 plates and cuts from Catherwood's drawings;
and in <i>Catherwood's Views of Anc. Mon.</i>, N. York, 1844, 25 colored
lithographs, with text by Mr Stephens. A French translation of Stephens'
description of Palenque is given in <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Palenqué</i>, pp.
14-27. Respecting the ability of these explorers, and the faithfulness of
their text and drawings, there can be but one opinion. Their work in Chiapas
is excelled only by that of the same gentlemen in Yucatan.&mdash;See <a href="#Page_146">p.
146</a> of this vol.&mdash;Without aid from any government, they accomplished in
20 days, at the height of the rainy season, the most unfavorable for such
work, more satisfactory results, as Stephens justly claims, <i>Cent. Amer.</i>,
vol. ii., p. 299, than any of their predecessors&mdash;except Waldeck, whose
drawings had not then been published.</p>

<p class="footnote">An anonymous account of the ruins appeared in 1845 in the <i>Registro
Yucateco</i>, tom. i., pp. 318-22. M. Morelet, of whom I have already
spoken, spent a fortnight here in 1846. <i>Voyages</i>, tom. i., pp. 264-84; <i>Travels</i>,
pp. 64-111, with cuts from other sources. In 1858, M. Désiré Charnay,
'<span xml:lang="fr">Chargé d'une mission par le ministre d'État, à l'effet d'explorer les ruines
américaines,</span>' visited Palenque; but his photographic efforts were less successful
here than elsewhere, and of the four views published in his Atlas,
only one, that of the tablet of the cross, is of great value in testing the accuracy
of preceding artists. His description, however, is interesting and
valuable as showing the effects of time on the ruins since Stephens' visit.
<i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, Paris, 1863, pp. 411-41, phot. 19-22; Remarks

<p class="footnote">In 1860, a commission appointed by the French government examined
and reported upon Waldeck's collection, which was found to contain ninety-one
drawings relating exclusively to Palenque, and ninety-seven representing
objects from other localities. The Palenque drawings were reported to
be far superior to any others in existence, a somewhat too decided <i><span xml:lang="fr">penchant
aux restaurations</span></i> being the only defect;&mdash;a defect, however, which is to a
greater or less extent observable in the works of all antiquarians, several
of Catherwood's plates being confessedly restorations. In accordance with
the report of the commission, the whole collection was purchased, and a
sub-commission appointed to select a portion of the plates for publication.
It was decided, however, to substitute for M. Waldeck's proposed text
some introductory matter to be written by the Abbé Brasseur, a man eminently
qualified for the task, although at the time he had never personally
visited Palenque. He afterwards, however, passed a part of the month of
January, 1871, among the ruins. The work finally appeared in 1866, under
the general title <i><span xml:lang="fr">Monuments Anciens du Mexique</span></i>, in large folio, with complicated
sub-titles. It is made up as follows:&mdash;I. <i><span xml:lang="fr">Avant Propos</span></i>, pp. i.-xxiii.,
containing a brief notice of some of the writers on American Antiquities,
and a complete account of the circumstances which led to the publication of
this work; II. <i><span xml:lang="fr">Introduction aux Ruines de Palenqué</span></i>, pp. 1-27, a historical
sketch of explorations, with translations of different reports, including that
of Stephens nearly in full; III. <i><span xml:lang="fr">Recherches sur les Ruines, etc.</span></i>, pp. 29-83,
being for the most part speculations on the origin of American civilization,
with which I have nothing to do at present; IV. <i>Description des Ruines, etc.</i>,
by M. Waldeck, pp. i.-viii; V. Fifty-six large lithographic plates, of which
Nos. i., v.-xlii., and l., relate to Palenque, including a fine map of Yucatan
and Chiapas. I shall refer to the plates simply by the name <i>Waldeck</i> and the
number of the plate. By the preceding list of contents it will be seen that
this is by far the most important and complete work on the subject ever
published. The publishers probably acted wisely in rejecting Waldeck's
text as a whole, since his archæological speculations are always more or
less absurd; but it would have been better to give his descriptive matter
more in full; and fault may be justly found with the confused arrangement
of the matter, the constant references to numbers not found in the plates,
and with the absence of scales of measurement; the latter, although generally
useless in the illustrations of an octavo volume, are always valuable
in larger plates. In addition to the preceding standard authorities on Palenque,
there are brief accounts, made up from one or more of those mentioned,
and which I shall have little or no occasion to refer to in my

latter being only a rough imperfect sketch. It is understood that a large portion
of the outer and southern walls have fallen, so that the visitors differ
somewhat in their location of doorways and some other unimportant details.
Stephens' plan makes the whole number of exterior doorways 50 instead of
40, and many doorways in the fallen walls he does not attempt to locate.
I give the preference to Waldeck simply on account of his superior facilities.</p>

fig. 22, make it 93 feet in three stories. Kingsborough's text mentions
no height, but his plates xvii-xviii., fig. 24, make it 108 feet in four stories.
The other authorities mention no height, but from their plates the height
would seem not far from 50 feet. See <i>Waldeck</i>, pl. xviii-xix., and all the
general views of the Palace. Waldeck, p. iii., severely criticises Dupaix's

417. <i>Waldeck</i>, pl. xx., is a fine view of this temple and its pyramid as
seen from the main entrance of the Palace. But according to this plate
the structure on the roof is at least 10 feet wide instead of 2 feet 10 inches
as Stephens gives it, and narrows slightly towards the top. This plate also
shows two <img src="images/t-30.jpg" width="11" height="10" alt="T" /> shaped windows in the west end. <i>Stephens</i>, vol. ii., pp. 344-8,

speaks of regular semi-circular arches at Palenque, and states that
he has himself seen several such arches in other American ruins. It is
very certain that no such arches exist at Palenque. Indeed, Dupaix himself,
notwithstanding Castañeda's drawings, says, p. 17, that semi-circular
arches were not used, and Lenoir, <i>Antiq. Mex.</i>, tom. i., div. ii., p. 74, repeats
the statement; although the latter on the same page speaks of the
'<span xml:lang="fr">voûtes cintrées</span>' as appearing among the ruins. Brasseur's statement
about arches in other ruins would be more satisfactory if he had seen fit to
give further particulars. 'This original mode of construction, which discloses
the principle of the arch, was not wanting in grandeur or boldness
of design, although the architects did not understand the science of curves,
and stopped short, so to speak, on the verge of the discovery.' <i>Morelet's

pp. 20, 24, notes a striking similarity between the arrangement of buildings
at Palenque and Yucatan. He also speaks of a remarkable inferiority
in the ruins of Palenque, compared to Chichen, Zayi, and Uxmal. <i>Hist.

construction, or decoration; and that the face of the priest in the Temple
of the Cross is of a different race from the sculptured heads in Yucatan.
'La sculpture ... indique un art plus savant qu'au Yucatan; si les proportions

de Palenqué,</span>' but remarks a difference in the sculptured and molded heads.
Sivers, <i>Mittelamerika</i>, p. 238, says that the stone reliefs of Uxmal belong
to a ruder primitive art; and that stucco was used at Palenque for want of
suitable stone, and for the same reason greater attention was paid to the
stone tablets at the latter ruins. See also <i>Reichardt</i>, <i>Centro-Amerika</i>,
pp. 26-9; <i>Prichard's Researches</i>, vol. v., pp. 345-6; <i>Foster's Pre-Hist. Races</i>,

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VI-68" href="#FNanchor_VI-68"><span class="label">[VI-68]</span></a> M. Viollet-le-Duc, judging from the nature and degree of art displayed
in the ruins, concludes that the civilized nations of America were
of a mixed race, Turanian or yellow from the north-west, and Aryan or
white from the north-east, the former being the larger and the earlier element.
Stucco work implies a predominance of Turanian blood in the
artists; traces of wooden structures in architecture belong rather to the
white races. Therefore he believes that Palenque was built during the continuance
of the Empire of Xibalba, probably some centuries before Christ,
by a people in which yellow blood predominated, although with some Aryan
intermixture; but that the Yucatan cities owe their foundation to the same
people at a later epoch and under a much stronger influence of the white
races. In <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, pp. 32, 45, 97, 103, etc. 'Here were the
remains of a cultivated, polished, and peculiar people, who had passed
through all the stages incident to the rise and fall of nations; reached their
golden age, and perished, entirely unknown. The links which connected
them with the human family were severed and lost, and these were the only
memorials of their footsteps upon earth.' Arguments against an extinct
race and Egyptian resemblances. <i>Stephens</i>, vol. ii., pp. 356-7, 436-57. Dupaix
believes in a flat-headed race that has become extinct, p. 29. After
writing his narrative he made up his mind that Palenque was antediluvian,
or at least that a flood had covered it. <i>Lenoir</i>, p. 76. M. Lenoir says that
according to all voyagers and students the ruins are not less than 3000
years old. <i>Id.</i>, p. 73. 'Catlin, <i><span xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</span></i>, March, 1867, p. 154,
asserts that the ruined cities of Palenque and Uxmal have within themselves
the evidences that the ocean has been their bed for thousands of
years,' but the material is soft limestone and presents no water lines. <i>Foster's

with German ruins, etc., they cannot date back of the Conquest. <i>Sivers</i>,
<i>Mittelamerika</i>, pp. 237-47. 'All of them were the Work of the same People,
or of Nations of the same Race, dating from a high antiquity, and in
blood and language precisely the same Race, ... that was found in Occupation
of the Country by the Spaniards, and who still constitute the great Bulk
of the Population.' <i>Squier</i>, in <i>Palacio</i>, <i>Carta</i>, pp. 9-10. Copan and Quirigua
preceded Palenque and Ococingo as the latter preceded the cities of
Yucatan. <i>Ib.</i> 'The sculptures and temples of Central America are the
work of the ancestors of the present Indians,' <i>Tylor's Researches</i>, pp. 189,

been for some time Director of road-construction in the state of Oajaca,
and states his intention of publishing at some future time 18 or 20 large
copper-plate engravings illustrating the antiquities of Mitla and others.
These plates, so far as I know, have never been given to the public. Carriedo
accompanied Mühlenpfordt, or Mihelenpforott as he writes the name,
and published some of the drawings, perhaps all, in the <i>Ilustracion Mejicana</i>,
tom. ii., pp. 493-8. Some of the German artists' descriptive text is
also quoted from I know not what source. <i>Tempsky's Mitla</i>, pp. 250-3, with
plates which must have been made up for the most part from other sources
than the author's own observations. García's visit, <i>Soc. Mex. Geog., Boletin</i>,
tom. vii., pp. 271-2. Sawkin's exploration, in <i>Mayer's Observations</i>,

are without value to the archæological student. Fossey's account,

<i>Viollet-le-Duc</i>, in <i>Id.</i>, pp. 74-104, with cuts. After Charnay had completed,
as he thought, the work of photographing the ruins, all his negatives
were spoiled for want of proper varnish. He was therefore compelled
to return alone, since he had exhausted the somewhat limited patience of
his native assistants, and to work day and night to take a new set of pictures.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-35" href="#FNanchor_VII-35"><span class="label">[VII-35]</span></a> Charnay, phot. xvii., gives a general view of the ruins, from which,
however, no clear idea can be formed of the arrangement of the structures.
The buildings are named or numbered as follows by the different authors;
Dupaix numbers them as they are marked on my plan; Carriedo and Mühlenpfordt
unite Nos. 1 and 2 under the name of 1st Palace, making No. 3 No.
2, and No. 4 No. 3; Charnay's 1st or grand palace is the northern building
of No. 1; his 2d is the eastern building of the same; his 3d and 4th are the
northern and western buildings respectively of No. 2. My No. 3 is called
by him the House of the Curate, and No. 4 is only mentioned by him without
name or number.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-36" href="#FNanchor_VII-36"><span class="label">[VII-36]</span></a> At the Conquest the ruins covered an immense area, but they now
consist of six palaces and three ruined pyramids. <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>,

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-37" href="#FNanchor_VII-37"><span class="label">[VII-37]</span></a> Dupaix's ground plan, pl. xxix., fig. 78, represents such a southern
building and mound, although very slight, if any, traces remained of the
former at the time of his visit. Martin's plan, given by Humboldt, shows
two shorter mounds without buildings; while Carriedo's plan locates no
structure whatever south of the court, and I have omitted it in my plan.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-38" href="#FNanchor_VII-38"><span class="label">[VII-38]</span></a> The dimensions are very nearly those of the plans of Martin and Castañeda,
who differ only very slightly. The dimensions given by the different
authorities are as follows: A. 12½×47½ varas, <i>Castañeda</i>; 13¼×46½
varas, <i>Martin</i>, in <i>Humboldt</i>; 40 mètres long, <i>Charnay</i>; 180 feet long,
<i>Tempsky</i>; 132 feet long, <i>Fossey</i>. C. 22×22 varas, <i>Castañeda</i> and <i>Martin</i>;
<i>d</i>, 7×35½ varas, <i>Castañeda</i>; 7½×34½ varas, <i>Martin</i>. Walls 1½ to 3½ varas
thick, <i>Castañeda</i>; 1½ varas, <i>Martin</i>. Height 5 to 6 mètres, <i>Humboldt</i>;
14 feet, <i>Fossey</i>. The height of the inner columns, to be spoken of later,
shows something respecting the original height of the walls.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-39" href="#FNanchor_VII-39"><span class="label">[VII-39]</span></a> Charnay, p. 264, describes the material of this filling as 'terre battue,
mêlée de gros cailloux.' His photographs of walls where the facing has
fallen show in some places a mass of large irregular stones, even laid with
some regularity in a few instances; in other parts of the ruins there seem
to be very few stones, but only a mass of earth or clay; and in still other
parts the wall has every appearance of regular adobes. Dupaix, p. 35,
says that sand and lime are mixed with the earth. '<span xml:lang="es">El macizo, ó grueso
de las paredes se compone de una tierra mezclada y beneficiada con arena y
cal.' 'De tierra preparada, hollada ó beneficiada cuando fresca y pastosa.</span>'
Tempsky, p. 251, declares the material to be rough boulders in cement.

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-53" href="#FNanchor_VII-53"><span class="label">[VII-53]</span></a> In the preceding pages it will be noticed that I have paid no attention
to the plates and description by Mr J. G. Sawkins, from an exploration in
1837, as given by Col. Brantz Mayer in his <i>Observations on Mexican History
and Archæology</i>, published among the <i>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge</i>.
My reasons for disregarding Sawkins' authority are, that the said
descriptions and plates are just sufficiently accurate to identify palace No.
1 with the one referred to, but otherwise constitute one of the most bare-faced
frauds recorded in the annals of antiquarian exploration in America.
The following points are more than sufficient to substantiate what I have
said:&mdash;1st. Sawkins reverses the cardinal points, respecting which the other
authorities agree, placing the principal building on the east of the court
instead of the north, etc. To avoid repetition and confusion, I shall in the
following remarks, however, correct this error and speak of each building
in its proper location. 2d. Sawkins found five standing columns in the
eastern building, <i>d</i>, four of which supported parts of a wall, while the
other standing apart was taller than the rest; now the columns supporting
the wall may have been the piers between the doorways&mdash;but only <i>three</i> of
these were standing in 1806 (see <i>Dupaix</i>, pl. xxxi.); and the taller column
standing apart agrees well enough with the truth, except that there were
<i>two</i> of them standing in 1859. (See <i>Charnay</i>, <i>Ruines Amér.</i>, phot. xii.)
On the west our explorer correctly found everything obliterated, and the
'crumbling and indistinct walls' which he found on the south may have
been part of palace No. 2. 3d. Coming now to the northern building,
Sawkins found in the front 4 doorways, so narrow and low that only one
person at a time could enter, and that only by stooping; during the next 20
years these doorways grew remarkably in size, and decreased in number,
since Charnay's photograph shows 3 doorways with standing human figures
in two of them, not obliged to stoop or much pressed for elbow room, as
may be seen in the copy I have given. 4th. Sawkins found all the adornments
removed from this façade; they were perhaps replaced before Charnay's
visit. 5th. In the interior, A of the plan, Sawkins found niches in
the end walls not seen by any other visitor. 6th. The six columns represented
by Martin and Dupaix as standing in the centre of this apartment,
had all been removed (!) at the time of Sawkins' visit. It was a strange
freak of the camera to picture them all in place 20 years later. 7th. But
Charnay's photographic apparatus had yet other repairs to make, for in the
northern wing, C, the walls of the interior apartments had all disappeared,
and even the interior surface of the outer walls, which enclosed the quadrangle,
had no mosaic work, but the panels presented only 9 long recesses
in three tiers on each side. Mr Sawkins' plates are two in number; one of
them presents a general view of this palace from the west, and although
faulty, indicates that the artist may have actually visited Mitla; the other
is a rear view of the northern building, gives a tolerably correct idea of
the construction of the walls, and may possibly have been made up from
the large plate in Kingsborough's work. I have no more space to devote
to Sawkins. He may have been already 'shown up' by some critic whose
writings have escaped my notice. It is proper to add that as Col. Mayer
apparently consulted only Humboldt's description of Mitla, it is not at all
strange that this zealous investigator and usually correct writer was deceived
by a pretended explorer.</p>

148, with two views apparently the same as by Gondra, an additional side
and front view of a pyramid, and a plan which bears no likeness to Gondra's,
representing perhaps a different part of the ruins. According to this
author the ruins were first made known in 1829 or 1830. The two accounts
are very perplexing to the student, sometimes resembling each other so
closely that one is ready to believe that Sartorius was the explorer from
whom Gondra obtained his information and drawings, in other parts so different
as to indicate that different ruins are referred to. I am inclined to
believe that Gondra's information did in part refer to some other ruin in
the same region. Gondra's account is also printed in <i>Diccionario Univ.

the east, and of the terrace walls at B, from the west. The latter also
gives a view of the small pyramid <i>b</i>, from the north. The plan given by
Gondra bears no resemblance to the other. It may represent ruins in other
parts of the plateau; it may be a faulty representation made up from the
explorer's description of the works that have been described; or, what is,
I think, more probable, it may refer to some other group of ruins in the
vicinity. It represents a collection of pyramids and buildings, bounded
on both the east and west by walls, one of which has an entrance close to
the brink of the precipice, while the other had no opening till one was
made by the modern settlers.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VIII-40" href="#FNanchor_VIII-40"><span class="label">[VIII-40]</span></a> <i>Nebel</i>, <i>Viage Pintoresco</i>. The drawing is geometric rather than in
perspective, and the author's descriptive text in a few details fails to
agree exactly with it. José M. Bausa gives a slight description in <i>Soc.
Mex. Geog., Boletin</i>, tom. v., p. 411, without stating the source of his information.
He locates the ruin 2½ leagues south-west of the pueblo. This
author states that Carlos M. Bustamante published a good account of the
ruin in 1828, in his <i>Revoltijo de Nopalitos</i>. Other accounts of Papantla
made up from the preceding sources, are as follows:&mdash;<i>Mayer's Mex. Aztec</i>,

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VIII-41" href="#FNanchor_VIII-41"><span class="label">[VIII-41]</span></a> The dimensions in Nebel's text are, 120 feet square and 85 feet high,
which must be an error, since the author says that the stairway in the plate
may be used as a scale, each step being a foot; and measuring the structure
by that scale it would be something over 90 feet square at the base and
about 54 feet high. The <i>Gaceta</i> says that the base is 30 varas (83 English
feet) square, and the steps in sight were 57 in number. Humboldt calls
the pyramid 25 mètres (82 feet) square and 18 mètres (59 feet) high, or,
in <i>Essai Pol.</i>, 16 to 20 mètres. Bausa, <i>Soc. Mex. Geog., Boletin</i>, tom. v.,
p. 411, calls the height 93 feet, with 53 steps.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VIII-42" href="#FNanchor_VIII-42"><span class="label">[VIII-42]</span></a> Bausa says the pyramid faces the north. The <i>Gaceta</i> account represents
the stairway as 10 or 12 varas wide. The plate represents the lateral
narrow stairways as single instead of double, and the niches as not extending
entirely across the wide central stairway. Only six stories are shown
in the plate, terminating in a summit platform on which stand two small
altar-like structures at the head of the lateral stairways. Nebel speaks simply
of a 'double stairway.' Humboldt agrees with the plate in the <i>Gaceta</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VIII-43" href="#FNanchor_VIII-43"><span class="label">[VIII-43]</span></a> The <i>Gaceta's</i> text says 342, but its own figures correctly added make
the number 378 as is pointed out by Marquez; and the plate accompanying
the same account makes the number 309. Fossey says 360 niches. Humboldt
made the number 378, which he supposed to relate to the signs of
the Toltec civil calendar.</p>

épars dans les champs de Tetzcuco.</span>' Bullock, <i>Mexico</i>, pp. 381-7, 399-400,
says, 'you pass by the large aqueduct for the supply of the town, still in
use, and the ruins of several stone buildings of great strength.... Foundations
of ancient buildings of great magnitude.... On entering the gates, to
the right are seen those artificial tumuli, the teocalli of unburnt brick so
common in most Indian towns.' The site of the palace of the kings of
Tezcuco extended 300 feet on sloping terraces with small steps; some terraces
are still entire and covered with cement. It must have occupied
some acres of ground, and was built of huge blocks of basalt 4 or 5 by 2½
or 3 feet. 'The raised mounds of brick are seen on all sides, mixed with
aqueducts, ruins of buildings of enormous strength, and many large square
structures nearly entire.... Fragments of sculptured stones constantly
occur near the church, the market-place, and palace.' Both Brasseur and
Bullock are somewhat given to exaggeration, and they also refer, probably,
to other remains in the vicinity yet to be described. 'The ruins of
tumuli, and other constructions of unbaked bricks, intermingled with platforms
and terraces of considerable extent, are still to be traced; and it is
asserted, that many of the Spanish edifices are constructed out of the ruins
of the Teocallis.' <i>Latrobe's Rambler</i>, pp. 184-5. Other authorities on Tezcuco:

further was perceptible than a natural structure of earth' like any natural
hill with many loose stones. An American engineer who had made excavations
confirmed the idea that the pyramids were natural, although artificially
shaped. <i>Tudor's Nar.</i>, vol. ii., p. 278.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_IX-89" href="#FNanchor_IX-89"><span class="label">[IX-89]</span></a> Sr Antonio García y Cubas, a member of the commission whose description
of Teotihuacan I have used as my chief authority, has since published
an <i><span xml:lang="es">Ensayo de un Estudio comparativo entre las Pirámides Egípcias
y Mexicanas</span></i>, Mexico, 1871, which I have received since writing the preceding
pages. He gives the same plan and view that I have used, also a
plan of the Egyptian pyramids in the plain of Ghizeh, and a plate representing
part of a human face in stone from Teotihuacan. The author made
some additional observations subsequently to the exploration of the commission,
and gives the following dimensions, which vary somewhat from
those I have given, especially the height: Sun&mdash;232 by 220 by 66 mètres;
summit, 18 by 32 mètres; slope, north and south 31° 3´, east and west 36°;
direction, E. to W. southern side, 83° N.W.; direction, N. to S. eastern
side, 7° N.E. Direction, 'road of the dead' 8° 45´ N.E.; line through centres
of the two pyramids, 10° N.W. Moon&mdash;156 by 130 by 46 mètres; eastern
slope, 31° 30, southern slope, 36°; summit, 6 by 6 mètres; direction, north
side, 88° 30´ N.W., east side, 1° 30´ N.E. The author thinks the difference
in height may result from the fact that the ground on which the pyramids
stand slopes towards the south, and the altitude was taken in one case on
the south, in the other on the north.</p>

<p class="footnote">The following quotation contains the most important opinion advanced
in the essay in question:&mdash;'The pyramids of Teotihuacan, as they exist to-day,
are not in their primitive state. There is now a mass of loose stones,
whose interstices covered with vegetable earth, have caused to spring up
the multitude of plants and flowers with which the faces of the pyramids
are now covered. This mass of stones differs from the plan of construction
followed in the body of the monuments, and besides, the falling of these
stones, which has taken place chiefly on the eastern face of the Moon, has
laid bare an inclined plane perfectly smooth, which seems to be the true
face of the pyramid. This isolated observation would not give so much
force to my argument if it were not accompanied by the same circumstances
in all the monuments.' The slope of these regular smooth surfaces
of the Moon is 47°, differing from the slope of the outer surface. The
same inner smooth faces the author claims to have found not only in the
pyramids, but in the tlalteles, or smaller mounds. Sr García y Cubas thinks
that the Toltecs, the descendants of the civilized people that built the
pyramids, covered up these tombs and sanctuaries, in fear of the depredations
of the savage races that came after them.</p>

<p class="footnote">Respecting miscellaneous remains at Teotihuacan the author says,
'The river empties into Lake Tezcuco, with great freshets in the rainy season,
its current becoming at such times very impetuous. Its waters have
laid bare throughout an immense extent of territory, foundations of buildings
and horizontal layers of a very fine mortar as hard as rock, all of
which indicates the remains of an immense town, perhaps the Memphis of
these regions. Throughout a great extent of territory about the pyramids,
for a radius of over a league are seen the foundations of a multitude
of edifices; at the banks of the river and on both sides of the roads are
found the horizontal layers of lime; others of earth and mud, of tetzontli
and of volcanic tufa, showing the same method of construction; on the
roads between the pyramids and San Juan are distinctly seen traces of
walls which cross each other at right angles.' He also found excavations
which seem to have furnished the material for all the structures.</p>

<p class="footnote">As to the chief purpose for which the <i>ensayo</i> was written, the author
claims the following analogies between Teotihuacan and the Egyptian pyramids:
1. The site chosen is the same. 2. The structures are oriented
with slight variation. 3. The line through the centres of the pyramids is
in the 'astronomical meridian.' 4. The construction in grades and steps is
the same. 5. In both cases the larger pyramids are dedicated to the sun.
6. The Nile has a 'valley of the dead,' as in Teotihuacan there is a 'street
of the dead.' 7. Some monuments of each class have the nature of fortifications.
8. The smaller mounds are of the same nature and for the same
purpose. 9. Both pyramids have a small mound joined to one of their
faces. 10. The openings discovered in the Moon are also found in some
Egyptian pyramids. 11. The interior arrangement of the pyramids is
analogous.</p>

Two other accounts of the trip were written&mdash;one by Juan Jaramillo,
which may be found in the same volume of Ternaux-Compans' work; and
the second by Coronado himself, an Italian translation of which appeared
in <i>Ramusio</i>, <i>Navigationi</i>, tom. iii., fol. 359, et seq., and an English translation
in <i>Hakluyt's Voy.</i>, vol. iii., p. 373, et seq. For an abstract of the
trip and discussion about the location of the route, see <i>Gallatin</i>, in <i>Amer.
Ethno. Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. ii.; <i>Squier</i>, in <i>American Review</i> for November,
1848; <i>Whipple, et al.</i>, in <i>Pac. R. R. Repts</i>, vol. iii.; and <i>Simpson</i>, in
<i>Smithsonian Rept.</i>, 1859, p. 309, et seq. The last is the best article on the
subject, and is accompanied by a map. All the accounts mention the
fact that the expedition passed through Chichilticale, but only the one
quoted describes the building.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XI-5" href="#FNanchor_XI-5"><span class="label">[XI-5]</span></a> In <i>Doc. Hist. Mex.</i>, série iv., tom. i., pp. 282-3. Mange's description
is as follows:&mdash;'One of them is a large edifice, the principal room in the
centre being four stories high, and those adjoining it on its four sides, three
stories; with walls two varas thick, of strong <i><span xml:lang="es">argamasa y barro</span></i> [that is,
the material of which adobes are made] so smooth on the inside that they
resemble planed boards, and so polished that they shine like Puebla pottery.
The corners of the windows, which are square, are very straight and
without supports or crosspieces of wood, as if made with a mold; the
doors are the same, though, narrow, and by this it is known to be the work
of Indians; it is 36 paces long by 21 wide, and is well built. At the distance
of an arquebuse-shot are seen twelve other buildings half fallen, also
with thick walls; and all the roofs burned out except one low room, which
has round beams apparently of cedar, or sabino, small and smooth, and
over them <i><span xml:lang="es">otates</span></i> (reeds) of equal size, and a layer of hard mud and mortar,
forming a very curious roof or floor. In the vicinity are seen many other
ruins and stories, and heaps of rubbish which cover the ground for two
leagues; with much broken pottery, plates, and <i><span xml:lang="es">ollas</span></i> of fine clay painted
in various colors and resembling the Guadalajara pottery of New Spain;
hence it is inferred that the city was very large and the work of a civilized
people under a government. This is verified by a canal which runs from
the river over the plain, encircling the settlement, which is in the centre,
three leagues in circumference, ten varas wide and four deep, carrying perhaps
half the river, and thus serving as a defensive ditch as well as to supply
water for the houses and to irrigate the surrounding fields.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XI-8" href="#FNanchor_XI-8"><span class="label">[XI-8]</span></a> Padre Garcés says, 'on this river is situated the house which they
call Moctezuma's, and many other ruins of other edifices with very many
fragments of pottery both painted and plain. From what I afterwards saw
of the Moqui, I have formed a very different idea from that which I before
entertained respecting these buildings,' referring to Padre Font for more
details. <i>Doc. Hist. Mex.</i>, série ii., tom. i., p. 242. Font's account is substantially
as follows:&mdash;'We carefully examined this edifice and its ruins;
the echnographical plan of which I here lay down [The plan does not accompany
the translation, but I have the same plan in another MS. which
I shall presently mention] and the better to understand it I give the following
description and explanation. [Here follows an account of the building
of the Casa by the Aztecs when the Devil led them through these regions
on their way to Anáhuac]. The site on which this house is built is flat on
all sides and at the distance of about one league from the river Gila, and the
ruins of the houses which composed the town extend more than a league
towards the East and the Cardinal points; and all this land is partially covered
with pieces of pots, jugs, plates, &amp;c., some common and others painted
of different colours, white, blue, red,' &amp;c., very different from the work of
the Pimas. A careful measurement made with a lance showed that 'the
house forms an oblong square, facing exactly the four Cardinal points ...
and round about it there are ruins indicating a fence or wall which surrounded
the house and other buildings, particularly in the corners, where
it appears that there has been some edifice like an interior castle or watch-tower,
for in the angle which faces towards the S.W. there stands a ruin with
its divisions and an upper story. The exterior place [plaza] extends from N.
to S. 420 feet and from E. to W. 260 feet. The interior of the house consists
of five halls, the three middle ones being of one size and the two extreme
ones longer.' The three middle ones are 26 by 10 feet, and the
others 38 by 12 feet, and all 11 feet high. The inner doors are of equal
size, two by five feet, the outer ones being of double width. The inner walls
are four feet thick and well plastered, and the outer walls six feet thick.
The house is 70 by 50 feet, the walls sloping somewhat on the outside.
'Before the Eastern doorway, separate from the house there is another
building,' 26 by 18 feet, 'without counting the thickness of the walls.
The timber, it appears, was of pine, and the nearest mountain bearing
pine is at the distance of 25 leagues; it likewise bears some mezquite. All
the building is of earth, and according to appearances the walls are built in
boxes [moldes] of different sizes. A trench leads from the river at a
great distance, by which the town was supplied with water; it is now nearly
buried up. Finally, it is perceptible that the Edifice had three stories, and
if it be true what the Indians say it had 4, the last being a kind of subterranean
vault. For the purpose of giving light to the rooms, nothing is
seen but the doors and some round holes in the middle of the walls which
face to the East and West, and the Indians said that the Prince whom they
call the "bitter man" used to salute the sun through these holes (which are
pretty large) at its rising and setting. No signs of stairs remain, and we
therefore suppose that they must have been of wood, and that they were
destroyed when the building was burnt by the Apaches.' <i>Font's Journal</i>,

They consist of very extensive fortifications, and other structures built of
hewn stone, the walls being yet twelve feet high, and two towers standing

and stone vases were found here. Finally, the whole account is doubtless
a hoax.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XI-36" href="#FNanchor_XI-36"><span class="label">[XI-36]</span></a> A writer in the <i>N. Y. Tribune</i>,&mdash;see <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vol. x., suppl., p. 95&mdash;describes
a pyramid on the Colorado River, without giving the locality.
It is 104 feet square, 20 feet high, and has at present a summit platform.
It seems, however, to have been originally pointed, judging from the débris.
The material is hewn stone in blocks from 18 to 36 inches thick,
those of the outer facing being out at an angle. This report is perhaps
founded on some of the ruins on the Colorado Chiquito yet to be mentioned,
or quite as probably it has no foundation whatever. 'Upon the
lower part of the Rio Colorado no traces of permanent dwellings have been
discovered.' <i>Whipple, Ewbank, and Turner</i>, in <i>Pac. R. R. Rept.</i>, vol. iii.,
p. 15. Arizona miners occasionally refer to the ruins of old Indian buildings
on the Colorado, 40 miles above La Paz, on the eastern side, similar
in character to those of the Gila. On Ehrenberg's <i>Map of Arizona</i>, 1858,
they are so located, and that is all that is known of them. <i>San Francisco

A writer in the <i>San Francisco Evening Bulletin</i>, July 3, 1868, says
that the most extensive ruins in Arizona or New Mexico are situated
above the high falls of the Little Colorado, 20 miles north of the San
Francisco Mountains. They extend for miles along the river, and include
well-made walls of hewn stone now standing to the height of six or
eight feet. Both streets and irrigating canals may be traced for miles.
This writer speaks of the Jesuit inscriptions. According to an article in
the <i>San Francisco Herald</i> of 1853, quoted in the <i>Cal. Farmer</i> of June 22,
1860, Capt. Joseph Walker found some remarkable ruins on the Colorado
Chiquito in 1850. He speaks of 'a kind of a citadel, around which lay the
ruins of a city more than a mile in length.' The streets were still traceable,
running at right angles. The buildings were all of stone 'reduced
to ruins by the action of some great heat which had evidently passed over
the whole country.... All the stones were burnt, some of them almost cindered,
others glazed as if melted. This appearance was visible in every
ruin he met with. A storm of fire seemed to have swept over the whole
country and the inhabitants must have fallen before it.' The central building
with walls 15 or 18 feet long and 10 feet high, of hewn stone, stood on
a rock 20 or 30 feet high, itself fused by the heat. The ruins seen by
Walker were in all probability similar to those described by Sitgreaves, and
the Captain, or the writer of this article, drew heavily on his imagination
for many of his facts.</p>

of the Piscao (Pescado, Zuñi?) the ruins of an ancient city, which
formed a square surrounded by double walls of stone 14 feet apart. The
space between the walls was divided into compartments 14 feet square,
opening into the interior. The houses were three stories high, the lower
story being partially subterranean. Large quantities of red cedar, apparently
cut for firewood, were found in connection with the buildings.

there is no resemblance in the descriptions.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XI-50" href="#FNanchor_XI-50"><span class="label">[XI-50]</span></a> Dr Hammond, a companion of Simpson, describes this room as follows:
'It was in the second of three ranges of rooms, on the north side of
the ruins. The door opened at the base of the wall, towards the interior
of the building; it had never been more than two feet and a half high, and
was filled two-thirds with rubbish. The lintels were of natural sticks of
wood, one and a half to two and a half inches in diameter, deprived of the
bark, and placed at distances of two or three inches apart; yet their ends
were attached to each other by withes of oak with its bark well preserved.
The room was in the form of a parallelogram, about twelve feet in length,
eight feet high, and the walls, as they stood at the time of observation, seven
feet high. The floor was of earth, and the surface irregular. The walls were
about two feet thick, and plastered within with a layer of red mud one
fourth of an inch thick. The latter, having fallen off in places, showed the
material of the wall to be sandstone. The stone was ground into pieces
the size of our ordinary bricks, the angles not as perfectly formed, though
nearly so, and put up in break-joints, having intervals between them, on
every side, of about two inches. The intervals were filled with laminæ of
a dense sandstone, about three lines in thickness, driven firmly in, and
broken off even with the general plane of the wall&mdash;the whole resembling
mosaic work. Niches, varying in size from two inches to two feet and a
half square, and two inches to one and a half feet in horizontal depth,
were scattered irregularly over the walls, at various heights above the floor.
Near the place of the ceiling, the walls were penetrated, and the surfaces
of them perpendicular to the length of the beam. They had the appearance
of having been sawed off originally, except that there were no marks
of the saw left on them; time had slightly disintegrated the surfaces,
rounding the edges somewhat here and there. Supporting the floor above
were six cylindrical beams, about seven inches in diameter, passing transversely
of the room, and at distances of less than two feet apart&mdash;the
branches of the trees having been hewn off by means of a blunt-edged instrument.
Above, and resting on these, running longitudinally with the
room, were poles of various lengths, about two inches in diameter, irregularly
straight, placed in contact with each other, covering all the top of the
room, bound together at irregular and various distances, generally at their
ends, by slips apparently of palm-leaf or marquez, and the same material
converted into cords about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, formed of two
strands, hung from the poles at several points. Above, and resting upon
the poles, closing all above, passing transversely of the room, were planks
of about seven inches wide, and three-fourths of an inch in thickness.
The width of the plank was uniform, and so was the thickness. They
were in contact, or nearly so, admitting but little more than the passage of
a knife blade between them, by the edges, through the whole of their
lengths. They were not jointed; all their surfaces were level, and as
smooth as if planed, excepting the ends; the angles as regular and perfect
as could be retained by such vegetable matter&mdash;they are probably of pine
or cedar&mdash;exposed to the atmosphere for as long a time as it is probable
these have been. The ends of the plank, several of which were in view,
terminated in lines perpendicular to the length of the plank, and the plank
appears to have been severed by a blunt instrument. The planks&mdash;I examined
them minutely by the eye and the touch, for the marks of the saw and
other instruments&mdash;were smooth, and colored brown by time or by smoke.
Beyond the plank nothing was distinguishable from within. The room
was redolent with the perfume of cedar. Externally, upon the top, was
a heap of stone and mud, ruins that have fallen from above, immovable by
the instruments that we had along. The beams were probably severed by
contusions from a dull instrument, and their surfaces ground plain and
smooth by a slab of rock; and the planks, split or hewn from the trees,
were, no doubt, rendered smooth by the same means.' <i>Hammond</i>, in <i>Simpson's
Jour. Mil. Recon.</i>, pp. 131-3.</p>

remains of timber were found in the city, which must have contained originally

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XII-55" href="#FNanchor_XII-55"><span class="label">[XII-55]</span></a> 'In such localities, the general feature of the landscape is very similar
to many parts of Devonshire, more especially to that on the eastern escarpment
of Dartmoor, and the resemblance is rendered the more striking
by the numerous stone circles, which lie scattered around.... These stone
circles point to a period in ethnological history, which has no longer a place
in the memory of man. Scattered in irregular groups of from three or
four, to fifty or more, these stone circles are found, crowning the rounded
promontories over all the South Eastern end of the Island. Their dimensions
vary in diameter from three to eighteen feet; of some, only a simple
ring of stones marking the outline now remains. In other instances the
circle is not only complete in outline, but is filled in, built up as it were, to
a height of three to four feet, with masses of rock and loose stones, collected
from amongst the numerous erratic boulders, which cover the surface
of the country, and from the gravel of the boulder drift which fills up
many of the hollows. These structures are of considerable antiquity, and
whatever they may have been intended for, have been long disused, for,
through the centre of many, the pine, the oak, and the arbutus have shot
up and attained considerable dimensions&mdash;a full growth. The Indians
when questioned, can give no further account of the matter, than that, "it
belonged to the old people," and an examination, by taking some of the
largest circles to pieces, and digging beneath, throws no light on the subject.
The only explanation to be found, is in the hypothesis, that these
were the dwellings of former tribes, who have either entirely disappeared,
or whose descendants have changed their mode of living, and this supposition
is strengthened by the fact that a certain tribe on the Fraser River,
did, till very recently live, in circular beehive shaped houses, built of loose
stones, having an aperture in the arched roof for entrance and exit, and that
in some localities in upper California the same remains are found, and the
same origin assigned to them.' <i>Forbes' Vanc. Isl.</i>, p. 3.</p>
